# Wireless Security

pre-shared key (psk) - Security authentication where the same password or key is bieng use on both th ewireless access point and any connecting clintdevices trying to gain acess to the network. 

Problems: Scalabiliity every employee will know the password, ansd it will not be a secret. 

no individiual user acountability. 

Enterpsie authentication system.  - use individual user credentals. Most widley used enterprise-grade autnentication method.  

802.1x 

WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) Origional 802.11 wireless security standard in wich is an insure security protocol.  - uses a pre shared key, can be brute forces. Relys on RC4 WEP USES A 24-BIT initilition vector (IV) if enough are captured. you can use aircrak-ng and crack it in about 2 minutes. 

WPA - Wi‑Fi protected access. desgined as a replaement for WEP uses TKIP is a new type of auth. Can quickly be cracked, . helps prevent an on-path. uses MIC message intregrity check. Allow’s to use interprise mode. 

WPA2 created as part of the IEEE 802.11i starndard and was first used wit wireless g and n and wirelss a and ac networks. 

CCMP - confidentality 

uses AES 128 bit key more security and confidentality. personal mode and enterprise mode. 

personal mode, uses a pre shared key 

enterprise mode - with centralized authentication. 

WPA3 Introduced in 2018 - SAE increased increption str. and supports GCM. larger encryption keys 

SAE - security protoocols that was designed to enhcned the handshake process used in wi-fi 

WPS - Wi‑Fi protected setup - network security standard aimed at simplifiying the setup of a secure network. designed to make it eaiser for non techincal users to set up secure networkds. 

WPS is vulnurable to brute force. disable to use of wpa.

1 open networks - no securitu 

2 WEP initilation vector. 

3 WPA is associated with the terms TKIP and RC4. 

4 wpa2 is associated with the terms of CCMP and AES 

5 WPA3 is assocated with SAE 

6 WPS use a push buton and should be disbled, insecure 

7 pre shared key - password used in personal mode 

8 enterprise mode is associate with using a username and password for each user. 

# Wireless Security Standards (N10-009)

### **Open Networks**

- **No security.**
- All traffic is in cleartext.
- **Exam Tip:** "Open = insecure."

---

### **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**

- **Original 802.11 standard** (very insecure).
- **Encryption:** RC4 stream cipher.
- **24-bit IV** (too small, reused often).
- Can be cracked in **minutes** with tools like **Aircrack-ng**.
- **Exam Tip:** *Obsolete, don’t use*.

---

### **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)**

- Temporary replacement for WEP.
- **Encryption:** TKIP (Temporal Key integrity Protocol).
- Uses **RC4**, adds **MIC (Message integrity Check)**.
- More secure than WEP but **still weak** — vulnerable to attacks.
- Supports **Personal (PSK)** and **Enterprise (802.1X)**.

---

### **WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2)**

- Standardized in **802.11i**.
- Introduced with 802.11g and beyond.
- **Encryption:** AES with **CCMP** (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol).
- **Much stronger security**.
- Two modes:
    - **Personal (PSK):** Shared password.
    - **Enterprise (802.1X):** Centralized authentication with RADIUS (unique usernames/passwords or certificates).

---

### **WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3)**

- Introduced in **2018**.
- **Stronger encryption (192-bit in Enterprise mode).**
- **SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals):**
    - Replaces PSK handshake → prevents offline brute force.
- Supports **GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)** for integrity.
- Stronger protection against password guessing and on-path attacks.

---

### **WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)**

- Designed to simplify Wi-Fi setup.
- Methods: **Push-button** or **PIN (NFC option on some gear).**
- **Major Vulnerability:** PIN method is brute-forceable.
- **Best Practice:** Disable WPS.

# ✅ Must-Know Exam Associations

1. **Open Networks** → No security.
2. **WEP** → RC4 + 24-bit IV → easily cracked.
3. **WPA** → TKIP + RC4 + MIC.
4. **WPA2** → AES + CCMP.
5. **WPA3** → SAE handshake + stronger encryption.
6. **WPS** → Push-button/PIN setup → insecure → disable it.
7. **PSK (Pre-Shared Key)** → Shared password (Personal mode).
8. **Enterprise Mode (802.1X)** → **Unique username/password** per user via RADIUS.
