# Layer 3 (Network)

How wer’re going to forward traffic using logical addresses. iP address IPV4 or IPV6. 

Logical addressing - IPV4 and IPV6 - AppleTalk, IPX are old versions. 

IP:

IPV4 - ex. 10.0.0.38/24 

Layer 3 switching (Routing) - 

packet switching - Data is devided into packets and then forwarded on. like mailing a letter through different mail facilities. 

circut switching - Dedicated communication link is established between the two deivices. like the old school phone lines. a dedicated and constant communication path is maintained for the duration of a converstion. 

message switching: data is divided into messaged which may be stored then forwarded. 

most networks are using packet switching. home networks, and small networks. 

Route discovery and selection: how to know which wya to let the traffic to go.  Manually configured as a static route or dynamically through a routing protocol using rouging tables isign rougint table. RIP OSPF and EIGRP

How to know which way to go can be done by routing protocols similar to GPS

Connection services: Augment layer 2 services to improve reliablity

flow control 

packet reordering - encures that all data reaches the reciver correctly at the end destination. 

ICMP - Sends error messages and operational information to an IP destination. 

ping , tracert

bandwidth usage

Router

Multi-layer switcher

## 🌐 Layer 3 — Network Layer (OSI Model)

> Purpose: Determines how traffic is forwarded using logical addressing (IP). Responsible for routing, packet forwarding, and path selection across networks.

### 🧠 Key Concepts

- Uses **logical addresses** (IPV4, IPV6) to identify devices across networks.
- Supports **packet delivery** between networks (unlike Layer 2 which is limited to a local segment).

---

### 🧾 Logical Addressing

- **IPV4 Example**: `10.0.0.38/24`
    - `/24` indicates the subnet mask (255.255.255.0)
- **IPV6**: Longer addresses, written in hex (e.g., `fe80::1`)
- **Legacy** protocols: AppleTalk, IPX — no longer in use

### 🔄 Layer 3 Switching (Routing Types)

| Type | Description | Analogy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Packet Switching** | Data is split into packets and forwarded independently | Like mailing separate letters |
| **Circuit Switching** | A dedicated communication path is created for the whole session | Like an old-school phone call |
| **Message Switching** | Whole messages are stored and forwarded later | Like handing off a written message at each stop |

> 🧠 Most networks today use packet switching (including your home router).

### 🧭 Route Discovery & Path Selection

> Goal: Decide the best path to reach a destination network
> 

Two ways to configure routes:

- ✅ **Static Routing** – Manually set paths
- ✅ **Dynamic Routing** – Uses protocols to auto-discover best paths

### Routing Protocol Examples:

| Protocol | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **RIP** | Distance-vector | Based on hop count, simple but outdated |
| **OSPF** | Link-state | Calculates fastest route using bandwidth |
| **EIGRP** | Hybrid | Combines features of both methods |

> Similar to a GPS choosing the fastest or shortest route based on live data.

### 🔗 Layer 3 Services

- **Connection Services**: Improve transmission reliability
    - Flow control
    - Packet reordering (ensures correct sequence)
- **ICMP** (Internet Control Message Protocol):
    - Used for diagnostics (e.g., `ping`, `tracert`)
    - Sends error and status messages (e.g., destination unreachable)

---

### 📈 Bandwidth Usage Concepts

- **QoS (Quality of Service)** often works at Layer 3 to prioritize critical traffic (VoIP, video).
- **Load balancing** and **routing metrics** influence path decisions and congestion handling.

### 🛠️ Layer 3 Devices

| Device | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Router** | Connects different networks, makes forwarding decisions |
| **Multilayer Switch** | Acts as both Layer 2 (switch) and Layer 3 (router) |
| **Firewall (Layer 3 capable)** | Can filter based on IP and ports |
| **Core Routers / Edge Routers** | Used in large enterprise and ISP networks |

### 📌 Summary

| Function | Layer 3 Role |
| --- | --- |
| Addressing | Assigns and uses IP addresses |
| Routing | Forwards packets based on routing tables |
| Diagnostics | Uses ICMP to test and report |
| Delivery | Ensures packets reach the destination subnet |
| Connection Enhancements | Works with Layer 2 to increase reliability |
