# MAC Flooding

Comprimize the switch by compromisign the MAC table. send too many fake MAC address tables the switch will enter fail safe and will act as a HUB 

Data snooping - occurs when an attacker captures sensitive data from the network the attacker can eavedrop in promiscous mode during the mac flood attack. 

Disrupting services - degrades network peformandce and sets the maca dderss 

Byassing security meaures - MAC flooding can bypass security measures like MAC address filtering. Switches may fail to enfore restrictions allowing unaothrorized devixes to access the network. 

use anomoly based IDS and employ netorm mononotring tools. c

configure port security to limit MAC addresses per port. 

Set limits on mac per seitch port. 

implivment VLANs to segregrate traffic. 

overflows the targest mac table. 

# MAC Flooding Attack

### Concept

- Attacker floods a switch with **fake MAC addresses** until the **CAM (MAC) table overflows**.
- When full, the switch enters **fail-open mode** and acts like a **hub**.
- Result: Traffic is broadcast to all ports, exposing data to the attacker.

---

### Impacts

1. **Data Snooping**
    - Attacker runs NIC in **promiscuous mode** to eavesdrop on traffic.
2. **Disrupting Services**
    - Network performance degrades as switch broadcasts all frames.
3. **Bypassing Security**
    - **MAC filtering / access controls** may fail, allowing unauthorized devices.

---

### Mitigation

- **Port Security:** Limit number of MAC addresses per port.
- **Anomaly-Based IDS/IPS:** Detect unusual flooding activity.
- **Network Monitoring:** Watch for abnormal MAC learning rates.
- **VLAN Segmentation:** Contain broadcast domains, reduce impact.

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- **MAC Flooding = Switch → Hub behavior.**
- Enables **data snooping + bypass of MAC filtering.**
- **Prevention:** Port security, IDS/IPS, VLANs.
