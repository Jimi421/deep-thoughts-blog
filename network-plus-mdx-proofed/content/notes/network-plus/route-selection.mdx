# Route Selection

Determines whithc path a route should take. 

Beliveablility of a route. 

RIP is older so less beliveable vs OSPF. 

AD administrative Distance - lower ad IS MORE TRUSTWORKTY or 

directly connected 0 always belived. 

static 1 - belive the admin

EIGRP 90 newist

OSPF 110 newer

RIP 120 oldest

External eigrp 170 older

UNKNOWN 255 

for exam know the order not the numbers. 

Metrics - 

hop count, belivibility, realibility, bandwidth delay ,costs other metrics. it’s like golf rules lowest sore is the highest cost. 

bandwidth 0 lowest cost 

for route selection all are. etter. 

# Route Selection (N10-009)

### **Administrative Distance (AD)**

- **Definition:** How “trustworthy” a routing source is.
- **Rule:** **Lower AD = more believable.**
- If multiple routes exist to the same destination → the one with the **lowest AD** wins.

**Common AD Values (memorize order, not numbers):**

- **0** – Directly Connected (always trusted most)
- **1** – Static Route (set by admin)
- **90** – EIGRP (internal)
- **110** – OSPF
- **120** – RIP (least believable common IGP)
- **170** – EIGRP (external)
- **255** – Unknown/invalid (never used)

👉 **Exam Tip:** Just know the **priority order**:

**Direct > Static > EIGRP > OSPF > RIP > External EIGRP > Unknown**

### **Metrics**

- Metrics determine the **best path** *within* a routing protocol.
- Think of metrics as the **score of the path** → like golf: **lowest = best**.
- Different protocols use different metrics:

| Protocol | Metric Used |
| --- | --- |
| RIP | Hop Count (max 15) |
| OSPF | Cost (based on bandwidth) |
| EIGRP | Composite (bandwidth, delay, reliability, load) |
| IS-IS | Cost |
| BGP | Path Vector (AS-path length + policies) |

---

✅ **Must-Know for Exam**

- **AD = trust between protocols. Metric = best path inside a protocol.**
- If a router knows a route from **OSPF (AD 110)** and **RIP (AD 120)**, it chooses **OSPF**.
- If it knows two OSPF routes, it chooses the one with the **lowest cost metric**.

    **A:** Directly connected.
    
- **Q:** Which has lower AD: OSPF or RIP?
    
    **A:** OSPF.
    
- **Q:** Which routing protocol uses hop count?
    
    **A:** RIP.
    
- **Q:** What does EIGRP use as a metric?
    
    **A:** Bandwidth + delay (composite).
    
- **Q:** What happens at AD 255?
    
    **A:** Route is invalid/unusable.
