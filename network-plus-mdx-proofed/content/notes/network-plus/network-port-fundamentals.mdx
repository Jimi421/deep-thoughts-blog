# Network port Fundamentals

Ip addresses street address. 

ports bedroo, kitchen ect. 

Port: Logical opening in a computer that represents a service or applicaion. 

Ports in a computer network: nUmbered from 0, to 65,535 

Well known ports 0 - 1,023.. 80,443, 53 ect. 

Registered ports -registired with IANA

Ephemeral ports. - short lived temp ports which are opened just for a small period of tiem for an application from 49,152 

so a client will always send to the well known port but will use an ephermerial port to send it from. 

# ðŸŽ¯ Ports & Port Ranges â€“ Key to Network Services

**Analogy:**

- **IP Address = Street Address** (where the device lives)
- **Port = Room Number** (which service/app you're trying to reach)

## ðŸ§© What is a Port?

> A logical number that identifies a specific service or application running on a system.

> Helps direct traffic to the correct process.

## ðŸ”¢ Port Range Breakdown

| Type | Range | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Well-known Ports** | `0â€“1023` | Assigned to common protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, etc.) |
| **Registered Ports** | `1024â€“49151` | Used by vendors/app developers (e.g., MS SQL, Oracle) |
| **Ephemeral Ports** | `49152â€“65535` | **Temporary, client-side ports** used when initiating a connection |

> ðŸ§  Clients send from an ephemeral port â†’ to a well-known or registered port on the server
>

## ðŸ“¡ Real-World Example

### Visiting a Website:

- Client uses **ephemeral port** (e.g., `49500`)
- Sends request to **port 443** (HTTPS) on the web server
- Server replies to clientâ€™s ephemeral port

## ðŸ§  Memory Trick

## ðŸ’¡ Common Well-Known Ports

| Port | Protocol | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 20/21 | FTP | File Transfer Protocol |
| 22 | SSH | Secure Shell |
| 23 | Telnet | Unencrypted remote login |
| 25 | SMTP | Sending email |
| 53 | DNS | Domain Name System |
| 67/68 | DHCP | Dynamic Host Configuration |
| 80 | HTTP | Web (unencrypted) |
| 110 | POP3 | Email retrieval |
| 123 | NTP | Time sync |
| 143 | IMAP | Email retrieval |
| 443 | HTTPS | Web (secure) |
| 3389 | RDP | Remote Desktop |
