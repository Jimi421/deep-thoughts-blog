# Rapid Remediation Notes (by question)

## Q6 – Console cable

**Correct:** Rollover (console) cable

**Must Know:** RJ-45 ↔ DB-9, pinout is reversed end-to-end; used to reach router/switch CLI via console.

**Memory Trick:** *“Roll over to the **console**.”*

**Common Confusion:** 

Crossover = device↔device Ethernet;

 Straight-through = host↔switch; RG-6 = coax.

---

## Q13 – Traffic directions

**Correct:** North (exiting the DC); South (entering); East/West (inside DC).

**Exam Tip:** If it **crosses** the perimeter device (FW/router) → North/South. Inside only → East/West.

**Memory Trick:** *North = up/out, South = down/in.*

---

## Q14 – Fast switch swap

**Correct:** Configuration backup

**Must Know:** Swap spare switch → restore saved config → instant parity.

**Common Question:** MTTR depends on having backups + spares.

---

## Q17 – Anomaly alerting

**Correct:** Streamlined analysis of security logs

**Must Know:** Alerts bubble up weird patterns so analysts don’t sift raw logs first.

---

## Q21 – Loop prevention (Layer 2)

**Correct:** 802.1D (STP)

**Must Know:** STP/RSTP stop L2 loops; 802.1Q = VLAN tagging; RIP/OSPF handle L3 routing (use split horizon, poisoning—not L2 loops).

**Memory Trick:** *D = “Don’t loop” (STP). Q = “VLAN tag.”*

---

## Q23 – OSI travel down the stack

**Correct:** Encapsulation (L7→L1)

**Must Know:** Sender = encapsulate; Receiver = de-encapsulate. Tunneling is separate concept; Tagging is 802.1Q at L2.

---

## Q24 – Survive disasters

**Correct:** Hot site / Cold site

**Must Know:** Only option that keeps the **business running** if the building is lost.

---

## Q27 – Monitor + block at gateway

**Correct:** Firewall on **external** interface + NIPS on **internal** interface

**Must Know:** Firewall takes the inbound beating; NIPS inspects/blocks content entering LAN and outbound as needed.

**Exam Tip:** Don’t put NIPS on the raw internet side (risk “fail open”).

---

## Q30 – Port for Fast Ethernet device

**Correct:** 100 Mb/s **full-duplex**

**Must Know:** Avoid auto-negotiation gotchas in mixed environments on the exam.

---

## Q35 – Microsecond sync

**Correct:** PTP (IEEE 1588)

**Must Know:** NTP = ms-level; PTP = μs-level.

---

## Q38 – Control bandwidth use

**Correct:** Traffic shaping

**Must Know:** Prioritize/delay classes; not the same as load balancing/HA/fault tolerance.

---

## Q41 – Radar compliance (DFS/TPC)

**Correct:** 802.11h

**Must Know:** DFS/TPC features (think 5 GHz radar coexistence).

---

## Q42 – Syslog severity: error

**Correct:** Level **3**

**Must Know (0–7):** 0-Emerg, 1-Alert, 2-Crit, 3-Err, 4-Warn, 5-Notice, 6-Info, 7-Debug.

**Memory Trick:** *“Every Alert Can Error While Notices Inform Debugging”* (0→7).

---

## Q49 – Bond links for speed + resiliency

**Correct:** LACP (802.3ad)

**Must Know:** LLDP = discovery, LDAP = directory, L2TP = tunneling.

---

## Q50 – Evening Wi-Fi slowdowns

**Correct:** Signal degradation (channel crowding/medium contention)

**Must Know:** Peak-time contention + co-channel interference = weaker effective SNR/throughput.

---

## Q51 – Auto-propagate VLANs

**Correct:** VTP

**Must Know:** Centralize VLAN adds/changes across a VTP domain. STP = loop-free tree; bonding = bandwidth; IGRP = routing.

---

## Q52 – 4 hours to fix device

**Correct:** MTTR

**Must Know:** MTBF = between failures; RTO = time goal to restore service; RPO = allowable data loss.

---

## Q59 – Link cut didn’t re-route

**Correct:** Static routing

**Must Know:** Dynamic protocols would reconverge automatically.

---

## Q60 – Kerberos special sauce

**Correct:** Tickets

**Must Know:** Kerberos = KDC/TGS, time-based tickets; RADIUS/Diameter ≠ ticket model.

---

## Q62 – Windows path tool

**Correct:** `tracert` (Windows) vs `traceroute` (Linux/macOS)

**Must Know:** `ping` = reachability RTT; `ip` = interface/route config (Linux).

---

## Q68 – Default gateway redundancy

**Correct:** FHRP (HSRP/VRRP/GLBP)

**Must Know:** Creates a virtual gateway; seamless failover.

---

## Q71 – 30 m copper limit at 40 Gb

**Correct:** Cat 8 (40 Gb up to 30 m; 10 Gb to 100 m)

**Exam Tip:** Cat6/6a do 10 Gb longer than Cat8’s 40 Gb spec.

---

## Q73 – Wi-Fi name term

**Correct (per item):** ESSID

**Reality check:** SSID is the common term; ESSID is the 802.11 “extended service set” term spanning multiple APs. If the stem emphasizes multi-AP coverage, “ESSID” appears.

---

## Q78 – Test T1 CSU/DSU interface

**Correct:** Loopback adapter

**Must Know:** Loops TX↔RX to validate the port and let carrier test to demarc.

---
