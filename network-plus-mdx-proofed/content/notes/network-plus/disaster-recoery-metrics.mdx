# Disaster Recoery Metrics

recovery metrics help measures. 

Availibity - uptime minuts up / total minutes. going for 99.999% 

Reliablilty not dropping packets. 

mean time to trepair - average time it takes to repai a newtork device when it breaks. 

mean time betwene failures - mtbf - mean time between failure. 

system failure, resume normal opperations, then a system failure again. 

MTD - Maximu, tolerable Downtime - longest period of time a buisness can be down without the buisness going under. depends on the orginization. 

split teams aross multiple locations, and 

RPO - recovery point objetive. what time do we need to get the data back. we need to have constant backups. if there is a ransomware then when you do a recovery from a backup, then you can get that data back. the shorter the ro=po the 

recovery time objective 

Redundant site considerations - redundant site - is a backup site that is sed in case of a disastar. 

hot site a fully equipped backup facility ready to swiftly take over in case of a primay site failure or disruption. need to have two of evetything and mirror the data bewtwen the sites. 

warm site - not fully equiped like a hot site. partially equipped backup site that can become opperational in a few days. has power phone lines, network connectivity, when a disastar happens you can procure the hardware you need at the time of a disastar. a hybrid model. 

cold site - a site with no immediate equipment or infrastructre but can be transformed into a backup facility. 

mobile site - a versitile site that utilizes indipendent portable units like trailers or tents to deliver recovey capabilities. 

DJC2 military HQ is an example. 

work from home is an example also. 

redundant connections - microwave link, local cable conneciton, cellular mobile. helps increas 

Virtual site 0 utilizes cloud - based environments and offers highly flexible approach to redundancy. 

Virtual hot site - fully replicated and instandly accessible 

virtual warm site.0 partially replicatd and scalable 

virutal cold site - minimal activation minimize costs. 

scalibility cost - effectiveness easy maintence. 

platform diversity - a vital aspect of redundant site development. network equimpnet and cloud providers. spread resources across multiple cloud providers. 

platform diversity also includs using different type of hardware equipment.
