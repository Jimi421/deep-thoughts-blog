# 2. Establish a theory of a probable cause and question the obvious.

Establish a theory - try to guess what the problem is. 

and question the obvious. 

probable cause- the most likley cause among all the different possible causes that may have happened. 

question the obvious - think about what is most likley to be the issue 

use tools and esources. ex.. netflix not working go to down detector. 

conduct research based on the symptoms that you’re observing. 

look at the machine listen do you hear the fan, are the lights on . are there clicking sounds, do you hear something burning. 

burning smell, dmaaed processor. 

clicking grinding -failing hard drive 

no fan spinning - no power or broken fan. 

try to reproduce the problem. - there may be times between when the issue happened and when you respond to the incident. 

use logs and other inter markers 

Top to bottom approach using the OSI model working from applicaton to the bottom. try port 80, then check encrypton, ext.. 

bottom up approach. start at layer 1 of the OSI model and work your way up to the top. “is it plugged in”.. are we getting connection to the switch. can i ping the router.. how about ping 8.8.8.8

Divide and conquer. start in the middle of the OSI mode. 

# Step 2 — Establish a Theory of Probable Cause (and Question the Obvious)

### Goal

- Form the **most likely** explanation based on symptoms, and **test the simple stuff first**.

---

## Quick Routine (Fast Wins)

- **Power & cabling:** device on? fan/lights? firmly seated cables? correct port?
- **Link status:** NIC/switch link light, speed/duplex (mismatches cause slow/erratic).
- **IP basics:** `ipconfig/ifconfig` → valid IP (not 169.254.x.x), subnet, **default gateway**, **DNS**.
- **Wireless basics:** correct SSID/VLAN, signal strength, not on captive portal.
- **Recent change?** (patch, config, move, new cable) → rollback/test.
- **Scope:** one user, a VLAN, a site, or the Internet? (narrows layers fast)

> Exam Tip: 169.254.x.x (APIPA) ⇒ DHCP problem.
> 
> 
> Can reach IP, not hostname ⇒ **DNS**.
> 
> Can reach gateway, not Internet ⇒ **routing/ACL/NAT**.

## Build & Rank Theories

1. **List hypotheses** from most common/simple to complex.
2. **Test minimally invasive checks** first.
3. **Change one thing at a time**; note the result.

**Use your senses:**

- **Burning smell/overheating** ⇒ PSU/fan/thermal.
- **Clicking/grinding** ⇒ failing HDD.
- **No fan/no LEDs** ⇒ power/fan failure.

---

## Reproduce & Gather Evidence

- Try to **reproduce** the issue; note exact errors/pop-ups.
- **Check logs**: Event Viewer/journalctl, app logs, syslog/SIEM.
- **Timing/patterns**: only at peak hours? only on Wi-Fi?

---

## Choose a Strategy (OSI)

- **Top-Down (App → Physical):** good when a **specific app** fails (e.g., web app 500s).
    - Tools: browser dev tools, `nslookup/dig`, `tracert/traceroute`, `ping`.
- **Bottom-Up (Physical → App):** good when **nothing works**.
    - Tools: check link, swap cable/port, cable tester, `ping` gateway/8.8.8.8.
- **Divide & Conquer:** start mid-stack (Layer 3).
    - If you can **ping the gateway**: L1–L2 likely OK; look at routing/DNS.
    - If you **can’t ping the gateway**: focus on L1–L2 (cable/VLAN/port).

---

## Tools to Confirm/Refute Theories

- **Connectivity:** `ping`, `tracert`/`traceroute`, `arp -a`.
- **Name resolution:** `nslookup`/`dig`.
- **Interfaces:** `ipconfig/ifconfig`, `netstat`, `ethtool`/`nmcli`.
- **Capture:** Wireshark/tcpdump (SYNs, DNS failures, resets).
- **External checks:** DownDetector, ISP status, speed test.

---

## Symptom → Likely Cause (Must Know)

- **“Connected, no Internet”** → DNS or default gateway/NAT.
- **Slow + CRC/FCS errors** → bad cable/EMI; check speed/duplex.
- **Intermittent Wi-Fi** → channel overlap, weak RSSI, AP overload.
- **One VLAN only** fails → switchport VLAN/tagging, DHCP scope for that VLAN.
- **Only one app fails** → app/server, ports, ACL, cert/TLS.

---

## Mini Scenario (How to Think)

> “Netflix won’t load on one PC.”
> 
- Obvious: other sites? other devices? Wi-Fi vs Ethernet?
- Check IP/DNS; try `ping 8.8.8.8` (works?) then `nslookup netflix.com`.
- If names fail but IP works → DNS theory strengthened. Try alternate DNS; test again.

---

### Common Question

**Q:** When should I use top-down vs bottom-up?

**A:** **Top-down** for **specific app** symptoms; **bottom-up** when **nothing works** (start with L1). **Divide & conquer** when time is short—test L3 (gateway) first.

---

### Memory Trick

**OOPS:** **O**bvious checks → **O**SI strategy → **P**robable cause list → **S**ingle-change tests.

## 5 Rapid Review Qs

1. User has 169.254.x.x. What’s your top theory?
2. Host pings gateway but not 8.8.8.8. Where do you look?
3. Name resolves fail, IP pings succeed. Likely cause?
4. Tons of CRC errors on one port. First action?
5. Only VLAN 20 hosts can’t reach DHCP. Hypothesis?

**Answers:** 1) DHCP issue. 2) Upstream routing/NAT/ISP. 3) DNS. 4) Replace cable/check duplex. 5) Trunk/access VLAN config or DHCP helper for VLAN 20.
