# IPV4 to IPV6.

transition to IPV6 will take some time similar to the transiion to electric vehicles. 

Dual Stack - Allows the coexistenca and simultanious operation of both IPV4 an. IPV6 protocols on the same networks. Routers and swithes are configured to understand and prosess both IPV4 an v6. allows for the gradual migration. The dual stack prefers IPV6. Depends on DNS if IPV6 fails then goes to IPV4. seamless fallback between v6 to 4. 

Tuneling. method ued to eable the communication of one network protocol within another by encapsulating the data. 

NAT64 - Tunneling involves encapsulin IPV4 packets. 

Encapsulation and decapsulaion IPV4 gateway will convert the packet to an IPV4 and IPV6. maingtains a translaition table to keep track of the mappings.
