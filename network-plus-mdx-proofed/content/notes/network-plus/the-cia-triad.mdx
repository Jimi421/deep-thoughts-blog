# The CIA Triad

By default networks are not secure. When they were created security was added. 

Confidentiality - concerned with keeping data safe and private. Encryption and authentication. 

Symmetric - both the sender and the reciver use the exact same key to encrypt/decrypt the message. Symmetric encryption is 1,00 faster than Asymmetric. 

Key Management - symmectric has an issue with havign to maks eure the key is the same and distributed. 

Asymmetric - two keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the data. 

PKI public key infrastructure - encrypts the info and facilitaes the key exchange using asymetric encryption like RSA. 

Key pair, public key, private key. sender uses the recivers public key to encrypt the data the reciver uses the private key to decrypt hte info. 

Symmetric used for faster data transfer, Asymmetric usedf for handshake and key exchange. 

Intregrity - Ensures that the data was not modified in transit or storage, verifying the origional source. prevents on path or spoofing. changing the code of the server to help themself. 

Hashing - running a string of data through an algorithim. matching of the hash sent and the has recived means there was integrity in the transmission. 

Availibility - can i get to the data when i want to and where i want to. need a redundant netowk

compramised by - crashing a router by sending improperly formatted data ( Ping of Death attack) 

Flooding the network (DoS and DDoS attacks) Having power outages. 

Using old routers and swithches that may die of old age.
