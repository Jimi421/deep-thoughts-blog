# Power over Ethernet (PoE)

Power over eihernet allows for pwer an data over the same cable 

POE 802.3af standared can provide 15.4 some power loss as the power is transmitted. so 12.95 is the minimum. 

POE+ 802.3at enhanced and increase the amount of power available for the devices. can provede up to 30, minimum is 25.5 wats

power budget exceeded error - occurs when the poer demand exceeds the power ofer ethernet power. if the budget is 

power budget - sum of all the dc power available to all devices to the switch. if the switch uses too many poe connections may have an issue 

check power requirments for each device, and compare that tht total for the POE device, if the powe excedes consider removing devices, or increase updrade capabalities. 

PoE+ 30 watts 

PoE 14.5 watts 

if plugging in the wrong device into the wrong standard device then you’ll get a incoreect standard error. ensure there is compabatability. some can use both but some video phones may only use PoE+ if you connect pow+ to a regular switch it won’t powe up.
