# Firewalls

Uses a set of rules defining the types of trafffic permitted on our networks. 

Software/hardware 

virtual/physical 

hostbased/network-based

NAT 

PAT

packet filtering fireall - permits or denies traffic based on packet header. 

session based firewall will allow info if yo uclick the link. 

combine ACL and permit and deny with a stateful capibilities. 

Next Gen firewall NGWF conducts deep paceet inspection . 

layers 5 6 and 7 to get indepth info. WAF

ACL access control list. a set of rules

switch - MAC address 

router ip address 

firewall - ip address . 

UTM unified threat managemt - combines firewall router, IDS , andimalware and other features into a singl edevice. 

# ðŸ”¥ Firewalls

## Purpose

- Control inbound/outbound traffic using a **set of rules**.
- Provide **network security, segmentation, and monitoring**.

## Types of Firewalls

- **Hardware vs. Software**
    - Hardware: dedicated appliances.
    - Software: runs on servers/PCs.
- **Physical vs. Virtual**
    - Physical: standalone devices.
    - Virtual: runs inside VMs/cloud.
- **Host-Based**
    - Protects a **single device**.
    - Example: Windows Defender Firewall.
- **Network-Based**
    - Protects an **entire network or subnet**.
    - Placed at perimeter or between VLANs.

## Firewall Methods

- **Packet Filtering Firewall**
    - Inspects packet **headers** (IP, port, protocol).
    - Works at **Layer 3/4** (Network/Transport).
    - Basic, fast, but limited.
- **Stateful Firewall (Session-Based)**
    - Tracks **active sessions**.
    - Allows return traffic if the session was initiated from inside.
    - More secure than stateless.
- **Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW)**
    - Performs **deep packet inspection**.
    - Can inspect traffic at **Layers 5â€“7 (Session, Presentation, Application)**.
    - Detects malware, intrusion attempts, application-level threats.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
    - Specialized firewall for **HTTP/HTTPS traffic**.
    - Protects web apps from **SQLi, XSS, CSRF, etc.**
- **Unified Threat Management (UTM)**
    - All-in-one appliance.
    - Combines **firewall, IDS/IPS, anti-malware, VPN, NAT/PAT**.
    - Easier to manage, but single point of failure.

## Supporting Concepts

- **NAT (Network Address Translation)**
    - Translates **private IPs â†’ public IPs**.
    - Hides internal structure.
- **PAT (Port Address Translation / NAT Overload)**
    - Many private IPs share **one public IP**.
    - Uses **unique port numbers** to distinguish sessions.
- **ACL (Access Control List)**
    - Firewall/router rules that **permit or deny traffic**.
    - Based on IP, port, protocol, etc.
    - Example:
        - Switch â†’ filters by **MAC address**.
        - Router â†’ filters by **IP address**.
        - Firewall â†’ filters by **IP + ports/protocols**.

âœ… **Exam Tips:**

- **Packet filter = header only**
- **Stateful = tracks sessions**
- **NGFW = deep packet inspection (Layer 7)**
- **WAF = protects websites**
- **UTM = all-in-one security box**
- **NAT/PAT = hide internal IPs**
