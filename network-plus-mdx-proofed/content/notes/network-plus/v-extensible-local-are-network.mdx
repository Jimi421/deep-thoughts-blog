# V Extensible Local are network

a network virtuiliztion trchnology that addresses the limitations posed by traditional networking. 

encapsulates ethernat frames within a udp packet. VLANs had a 12 bit ID so could only have 4096 users .

layer 2 ethernat frames within layer 3 UDP packets. has a vni whish is 24 bit. 16 million IDs 

VXLAN tulnnel end pints - performes the encap and decap of ethernet fames into VXLAN packets .normally within hypervisors 

VXLAN segments - layer2 network overlaid onter a layer3 network that is then identefied by a unique 24 bit VNI. 

Scalability - supports up to 16 million virtual networks. 

Flexability - Extend layer 2 networs across diffeent data centers or cloud environments. 

improved utilization - Optimizes traffic flows within and across data centers. 

Complex to configure. 

latency- increased packet size and overhead 

configuration - multicast support and unknown unicast traffic is needed. youâ€™ll want to use management and orchestration tools.
