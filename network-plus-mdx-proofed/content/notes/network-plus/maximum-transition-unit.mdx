# Maximum Transition Unit

Refers to the larges size in a unit. the frame size is measured in bytes. ensureis that data works efficently 

MTU too high = packet los 

MTU too small = increased overhead. 

Standard MTU sized for wired ethernet si 1500 bytes. normally good enough. 

smaller MTU is used on wireles networks. 

VPN 

PPPOE use encaplulasion that adds extra packets. 1400 and 1450 

Jumbo frames - refres to any frame that exceed the standard or default size. jumbo frames have a default of 9000 bytes. can reduce overhead in data transfer network like storage area network large file transfers video streaming.
