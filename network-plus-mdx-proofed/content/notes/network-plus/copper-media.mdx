# Copper Media

Default type of cable used in networks for decades 

IEEE 802.3 Standard - Defines the physical layer and data link layerâ€™s media access control (MAC) for wired Ethernet networks. 

I802.3 

different types of cables under this standard. 

Copper: 

Twisted pair cable - A type of wiring in which two conductors of a single circut are twisted together. They are the preferred method for transmitting both data and voice. 

Unshielded Twisted pair. (UTP) 

Composted of two pairs of wires twited together, without additional shidleing addind to the cable. 

Lightweight, Flexible, Cost-Effective 

No shielding so itâ€™s smaller in diamater. 

STP( Shielded twisted pair. 

designed with a layer of insulation or shielding. 

Used where there is a high amount of electromagnetic interferince. helps against crosstalk. 

More expensive, bulkier, more difficult to install. 

Each cable is catagorized as a number:

CAT 5 100 Mbps, 100 meters max, 100 MHz FREQ. 100 BASE T (Fast Ethernet) 

CAT 5e 1000 Mbps/ 1GPS, 100 Meters Mwx, 100 MHz frequency. more twits, and reduces crosstalk and can have more speee. 

CAT6 1 Gbps, 100 meters 150 mhz. 1-0 gigabit ethernit 100bast T, depending on the legenth. 

CAT 6a 10 Gbps 100 meters maximum, 500 MHz FREQUENCY 10G increased crosstalk 

CAT 7 10 Gbps 100 meters max, 600 MHZ frequency, 10G base T 10 gig ethernet. 

CAT 8 up to 40 Gbps, 30 METERS maxium 200 Mhz 2 GHZ, designed for high speed data transfer and shorter distances between servers. 

Coaxial (Coax) Cable. 

Single copper conducter at its core and a shield around it. 

RG-6 used to support faster internet speeds wehn using cable. 

RG - 59 older cables htaht are only used for analog video and closed circut tv. 

most modern coax cables cupport speed up to 1gbps and up to 300 meters. 

Direct Attach Cpper (DAC) 

a form so fixed assembly copper cabling used to connect switches routers in datacenters. 

100 GBps at 15 meters or less 

100GBps at 7 meters 

high speed data transmission up to 100 GBPS

Twinaxial cable 

often a componet of a DAC and is considered a specialized form of cable. Two coax, high speed and short distandt. 

sFP+ and

10 100 mters 

100 gpts 7 meters. 

plenum vs non penum cals. 

plenum desighed with fire retardation must be used if used in air ways that are used for fire circulation. 

non plenum without fire retardation. can not be used in plenum spaces.

# Ethernet Cabling (IEEE 802.3)

### Twisted Pair Copper

- **UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)**
    - Lightweight, flexible, cheap.
    - No shielding â†’ more vulnerable to EMI/crosstalk.
- **STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)**
    - Foil/braided shield protects from EMI.
    - Thicker, costlier, harder to install.

**Cable Categories:**

- **Cat 5** â€“ 100 Mbps, 100 m, 100 MHz (Fast Ethernet).
- **Cat 5e** â€“ 1 Gbps, 100 m, 100 MHz (extra twists, reduced crosstalk).
- **Cat 6** â€“ 1 Gbps @ 100 m / 10 Gbps @ â‰¤55 m, 250 MHz.
- **Cat 6a** â€“ 10 Gbps, 100 m, 500 MHz.
- **Cat 7** â€“ 10 Gbps, 100 m, 600 MHz (shielded).
- **Cat 8** â€“ Up to 40 Gbps, 30 m, 2 GHz (short-run, data centers).

ðŸ‘‰ **Exam Tip**: Cat 5e = gigabit standard for most LANs; Cat 6a/7/8 = high-speed/data center.

---

### Coaxial Cable

- **RG-6** â€“ Used for modern broadband/cable internet.
- **RG-59** â€“ Older, analog CCTV.
- Speed: up to ~1 Gbps, distance ~300 m.
- Uses BNC or F-type connectors.

ðŸ‘‰ **Common Question**: Which coax type is still used in cable internet? â†’ **RG-6**.

---

### Direct Attach Copper (DAC)

- Pre-terminated twinaxial assemblies (short-run, switch-to-switch).
- **Speeds**: Up to 100 Gbps.
- **Distance**: ~7â€“15 m.
- Uses SFP+/QSFP connectors.

ðŸ‘‰ Must Know: DAC = **data center high-speed interconnect**.

---

### Twinaxial (Twinax)

- Specialized form of coax with **two conductors**.
- Commonly used in DAC cables.
- Short distance, high speed (10â€“100 Gbps).

---

### Plenum vs. Non-Plenum

- **Plenum cable**: Fire-resistant, low-smoke; required in HVAC ducts/air circulation spaces.
- **Non-plenum**: Cheaper, standard insulation; not for plenum spaces.

ðŸ‘‰ **Exam Tip**: If the question mentions *air ducts / ceilings*, answer = **Plenum-rated cable**.

âœ… **Rapid Review Qâ€™s**

1. Whatâ€™s the max speed/distance of Cat 6a?
2. Which coax type is used for cable internet?
3. Whatâ€™s the key difference between UTP and STP?
4. Which cable is required in HVAC ducts?
