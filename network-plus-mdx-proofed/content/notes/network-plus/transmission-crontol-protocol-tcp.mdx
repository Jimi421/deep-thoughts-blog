# Transmission Crontol Protocol (TCP)

A fundamental protocol within the internet protocol suite that consists of set of rules that goven the exchange of data/

Error checking 

Data checking a

Acknowledgemetn 

Works at laeyer 4 of the oci MODEL. 

tcp ensure reliable transmission of data by breaking down larger messages into smaller packets. 

TCP == 3 WAY HANDSHAKE 

SYN > syn ack > ack 

Error checking and flow control. 

Employs flow control 

Windowing: Allows the reciver to specify the amount of data it can handle at a time.

Port a numerical identifier in TCP/IP and other network protocols that helps distinguish between differnet services or applications. 

Source and Destination IP 

Source and Destionation Ports. 

Ports are important in the communiation process because these ports allow for multiple network applications. 

# 🔁 TCP – Transmission Control Protocol (Layer 4)

**A fundamental protocol of the Internet Protocol Suite**

Ensures **reliable**, **ordered**, and **error-checked** delivery of data between devices.

## ✅ Key Features of TCP

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Connection-oriented** | Establishes a session using **3-way handshake** |
| **Reliable** | Guarantees delivery, **retransmits lost packets** |
| **Sequencing** | Ensures packets arrive in correct order |
| **Acknowledgments** | Confirms receipt of data |
| **Flow Control** | Prevents sender from overwhelming the receiver |
| **Error Checking** | Uses **checksums** to verify data integrity |

  | ----------- SYN ---------->  |
  | <-------- SYN-ACK ---------  |
  | ----------- ACK ----------> |
  ✅ Connection Established

## 🔳 Windowing (Flow Control Mechanism)

- **Receiver tells sender how much data it can handle**
- Helps prevent **congestion or dropped packets**
- TCP dynamically adjusts the **window size** for efficiency

> 🧠 Bigger window = more data at once
> 
> 
> **Smaller window = slower, more reliable transfer**

## 🔢 Ports: Identifiers for Network Services

- **Numerical values** used to distinguish between different apps/services
- Work with **IP addresses** to complete connections

| Element | Example |
| --- | --- |
| **Source IP** | 192.168.1.10 |
| **Destination IP** | 10.0.0.5 |
| **Source Port** | 49512 (ephemeral) |
| **Destination Port** | 443 (HTTPS) |

> 🔑 Ports enable multiple network apps to run at once on the same device

## 🧠 Memory Aid

> TCP = "Total Care Protocol" → Reliable, caring, confirms delivery
> 
> 
> **Ports = App Doors** → Each port = entry for a different network service
