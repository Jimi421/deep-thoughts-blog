# Network Service Ports and Protocols

Different services that ensure that network devices can discover each other communicat efficently and relya importan system information to each other. 

DNS: Domain name system, used to translate human-friendly domaninnames to an IP address that computers can use to find a computer. uses PORT 53. uses TCP,large message and UDP, small messages

DHCP : Dynamic Host Configuration Protool DHCP- used to automate the assignment of ip addresses, submets, mass gateways, and otehr networking paramerers to a client device. listen for client requetst to port 67 and the clients will receive on port 86

SQL Services - Protocols used by database servers to manae queries an control operati0ons from the client applicaton sthat are requeting  them. Microsoft SQL - 1433 MY SQL 3306 can manage 

sSNMP -simple network management protocol. Used for collection information from and configureing diffent network devices like servers, hubs, printers, routers 161 and 162. used by SNMP managers port 162 

Syslog - Stanard for message logging that allows devices to send event messages adcros IP networks to an event message collector known as a syslog server. port 514 using UDP or TCP. 

needed for the managmt fo the network

syslog port 514 for system logs. 

## **Network Service Ports & Protocols (High-Yield)**

Services that let devices discover each other, communicate efficiently, and exchange essential system info.

---

### **1. DNS – Domain Name System**

- **Purpose:** Translates human-friendly domain names → IP addresses.
- **Ports:**
    - **53 TCP** → large queries (e.g., zone transfers)
    - **53 UDP** → small queries (most lookups)
- **Exam Tip:** Think of DNS as the **phonebook of the internet**.

---

### **2. DHCP – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**

- **Purpose:** Automatically assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS info to clients.
- **Ports:**
    - **67 UDP** → server listens (requests from client)
    - **68 UDP** → client listens (responses from server)
- **Exam Tip:** DHCP **DISCOVER → OFFER → REQUEST → ACK** (DORA process).

---

### **3. SQL Services**

- **Purpose:** Manage database queries and operations between client apps and database servers.
- **Common Ports:**
    - **1433 TCP** → Microsoft SQL Server
    - **3306 TCP** → MySQL
- **Must Know:** Often targeted in attacks (SQL injection).

---

### **4. SNMP – Simple Network Management Protocol**

- **Purpose:** Monitors and configures network devices (routers, switches, printers).
- **Ports:**
    - **161 UDP** → manager queries agents
    - **162 UDP** → agents send traps to manager
- **Versions:** v1, v2c (community strings), v3 (secure with encryption/authentication).

---

### **5. Syslog**

- **Purpose:** Standard for sending event/log messages across IP networks to a central log server.
- **Ports:**
    - **514 UDP/TCP**
- **Use:** Network monitoring & SIEM integration.

### **Quick Port Reference Table**

| Service | Port(s) | Protocol | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DNS | 53 TCP/UDP | Name resolution | TCP for large queries, UDP for normal |
| DHCP | 67/68 UDP | IP config automation | DORA process |
| Microsoft SQL | 1433 TCP | Database | Server-based DB |
| MySQL | 3306 TCP | Database | Open-source DB |
| SNMP | 161/162 UDP | Network mgmt | v3 = secure |
| Syslog | 514 UDP/TCP | Log collection | Centralized logging |

**Memory Trick:**

**"Do Data Services So Smartly"** → **DNS (53), DHCP (67/68), SQL (1433/3306), SNMP (161/162), Syslog (514)**
