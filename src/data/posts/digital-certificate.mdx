# üîë Digital Certificates

## Core Definition

- A **digitally signed electronic document** that binds a **public key** to a user, device, or organization‚Äôs identity.
- Ensures **authentication, integrity, and trust**.

## Types of Certificates

- **Wildcard Certificate**
    - Covers **all subdomains** of a domain.
    - Easier management.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è If revoked/compromised, **all subdomains** are affected.
- **Subject Alternative Name (SAN) Certificate**
    - Lists **multiple domains, subdomains, or IPs** in one cert.
    - Common for organizations with several domains.
- **Single-Sided Certificate**
    - Only the **server** is validated.
    - Example: Standard HTTPS website.
- **Dual-Sided (Mutual) Certificate**
    - Both **server and client** validate each other.
    - Example: VPNs, high-security enterprise networks.
- **Self-Signed Certificate**
    - Signed by the same entity it certifies.
    - Not trusted by browsers by default.
    - Used in labs or internal testing.
- **Third-Party (CA-Issued) Certificate**
    - Signed by a **trusted Certificate Authority (CA)**.
    - Widely trusted in browsers and systems.

## Supporting Concepts

- **Root of Trust**
    - Trust starts with a **root CA certificate**.
    - All subordinate certificates are trusted if the root is trusted.
- **Registration Authority (RA)**
    - Verifies user info on behalf of the CA.
    - Issues certificates after approval.
- **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**
    - A block of text with organization details and public key.
    - Submitted to a CA to request a certificate.
- **CRL (Certificate Revocation List)**
    - A list of revoked certificates.
    - Typically revoked for compromise, expiration, or policy violations.
- **Key Recovery Agent (KRA)**
    - Special tool/service that can **restore lost or corrupted keys**.

‚úÖ **Exam Tips:**

- **Wildcard = all subdomains**
- **SAN = multiple domains/IPs**
- **Single vs Dual = who‚Äôs validated**
- **Self-signed = not trusted by default**
- **CRL = revoked cert list**
