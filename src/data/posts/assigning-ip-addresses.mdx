# Assigning IP Addresses

Modern networks blend **static** and **dynamic** addressing. Critical infrastructure such as servers may keep a fixed address, while client devices generally rely on automated services like DHCP. Understanding how these options interact with name resolution helps diagnose connectivity issues quickly.

## Static Assignment

- Administrators manually configure the **IP address**, **subnet mask**, **default gateway**, and **DNS servers**.
- Provides deterministic addressing for devices that must always be reachable (servers, printers, appliances).
- Can be time-consuming and error-prone at scale.

## Dynamic Assignment (DHCP)

- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** automatically provisions addressing details from a defined scope or pool.
- Supplies required parameters such as the IP address, subnet mask, gateway, DNS servers, lease timers, and more.
- Replaced legacy **BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol)** while remaining backward compatible with its concepts.

## Legacy BOOTP

- Early protocol that could assign IP addresses and download a boot image from the network.
- Important historically, but modern environments have moved to DHCP for scalability and manageability.

## APIPA and Zeroconf

- **APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)** assigns a link-local address in the `169.254.0.0/16` range when a system cannot reach a DHCP server and lacks a static configuration. APIPA enables local communication but not Internet access.
- **Zero Configuration (Zeroconf)** technologies extend APIPA with multicast DNS (mDNS) name resolution and service discovery. Implementations include **Apple Bonjour**, **Windows LLMNR**, and **Linux systemd-resolved**.

## Name Resolution Services

- **DNS (Domain Name System)** translates domain names to IP addresses and vice versa.
- **WINS (Windows Internet Naming Service)** provided legacy NetBIOS name resolution and may persist in older Windows environments.

## Exam Highlights

- DHCP is the modern successor to BOOTP.
- Seeing a `169.254.x.x` address indicates a DHCP failure and APIPA fallback.
- Static assignments suit infrastructure devices; dynamic assignments suit client fleets.
- Zeroconf layers mDNS and discovery on top of link-local addressing.
- WINS remains relevant only for legacy NetBIOS support.
