# Assigning IP Addresses

static assignemnt: manually typing in the IP address. can be time consuming and prone to error. static assignemts is impractical on large enterprise neteorks. 

Dynamic Assignment - Dunamic allocation of i addresses. 

most SOHO network devices already run a DHCP server. 

IP address, Subnet mask, Default gateway, DNS server 

DNS domain name server - converts domain name to IP address. 

winswindows intenr naming sevice - identifies netbios names and converts it to a 

bootp - Dynamically assigns ip addresses and allwos workstatons to load a copy of the boot image offer the network. 

DHCP - Dynamic host configuration protocol 0 assigns an ip address automatically based on a scope. will provide all the needed info . 

DHCP is the modern impelemtntation off Boot 

Automatic private iPA addressing (Apipa) used with a device does not have a static IP address or cannot reach the DHCP server. these will automatialy set up a network, but cannot reach the internet. 

Zero configuratpion (zeroconf) newer tech based on apippa can assign an IPV4 link local address to a cline. resolve computer names to ip addesses with MDNS perform a service diesovery on a newtork. called Bonjour on apple, called LLMNR on windows, on lynix it’s called system D. 

# IP Address Assignment & Name Resolution (N10-009)

### **Static Assignment**

- **Manual configuration** of IP, subnet mask, gateway, DNS.
- **Pros:** Full control, predictable.
- **Cons:** Time-consuming, error-prone, impractical in large networks.
- Common for **servers, printers, network appliances** (devices that need consistent addressing).

---

### **Dynamic Assignment**

- Done with **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**.
- Provides:
    - **IP address**
    - **Subnet mask**
    - **Default gateway**
    - **DNS server** (and more, like lease times).
- Used in **SOHO and enterprise networks**.
- Modern replacement for **BOOTP** (Bootstrap Protocol).

---

### **BOOTP**

- Early protocol for dynamic addressing.
- Could assign IP + allow loading of a **boot image** from the network.
- Predecessor of DHCP.

---

### **DHCP**

- **Modern, automated IP assignment** based on a **scope/pool**.
- Reduces admin overhead.
- Can integrate with **DNS** for dynamic updates.

---

### **APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)**

- Range: **169.254.0.0 – 169.254.255.255** (/16).
- Used when:
    - No static IP set.
    - DHCP server unavailable.
- Allows local communication (link-local) but **not Internet access**.
- **Exam Tip:** If you see **169.254.x.x** → DHCP failure.

---

### **Zero Configuration (Zeroconf)**

- Builds on APIPA with **extra features**:
    - Assigns IPV4 link-local address.
    - Resolves names with **mDNS** (multicast DNS).
    - Service discovery.
- Implementations:
    - **Apple → Bonjour**
    - **Windows → LLMNR**
    - **Linux → systemd-resolved**

---

### **Name Resolution Services**

- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Converts domain names ↔ IP addresses.
- **WINS (Windows Internet Naming Service):** Legacy; resolved **NetBIOS names → IP**. Deprecated but may appear in older environments.

---

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- **DHCP = modern BOOTP.**
- **APIPA = 169.254.x.x (DHCP failure).**
- **Static vs Dynamic = servers vs clients.**
- **Zeroconf** adds mDNS + service discovery (Bonjour, LLMNR).
- **WINS = NetBIOS to IP (old Windows).**
