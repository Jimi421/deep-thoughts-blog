# Log Aggragarion with Syslog

Information 

Events 

Warning 

Alerts 

Routers 

Switches 

Servers 

SIM - Security Information management 

SEM - Security Evnet management 

SIEM Security information and event management .

client - sends logs infor to the syslog server. 

server - recived and stores all the logs from the clients

the server sends data over 514 udp. 

8 severity levels 0 to 7 

0 - Emergency - system unstable 

1 - alert - a condition should be corrected immediatly 

2 - critical - faluie in the systems primary application 

3 - error - something is preventing proper systme function 

4 - warning- error will occor if action is not taken 

5 - notice - the events are unusiual 

6 - information - normal message no action required 

7 - debugging - useful info for developers. 

Traffic logs - info about traffic from the networks.

# 📝 Log Aggregation with Syslog

## 🔑 Purpose

- Collects and centralizes **logs** from network devices and servers.
- Provides visibility into **events, warnings, alerts, and traffic logs**.
- Foundation for **monitoring, troubleshooting, and security analysis**.

---

## ⚙️ Syslog Components

- **Client** → Device that sends logs (routers, switches, servers).
- **Server (Syslog collector)** → Receives and stores logs.
- **Transport** → Uses **UDP 514** by default (can use TCP/TLS for reliability).

---

## 📊 Syslog Severity Levels (0–7)

- **0 – Emergency** → System unstable.
- **1 – Alert** → Immediate action required.
- **2 – Critical** → Failure in primary system function.
- **3 – Error** → Preventing proper system function.
- **4 – Warning** → Potential issue if no action is taken.
- **5 – Notice** → Unusual but not an error.
- **6 – Informational** → Normal events, no action needed.
- **7 – Debug** → Developer-level detail.

👉 **Exam Tip:** Severity levels run **0 (highest priority)** → **7 (lowest priority)**.

## 🔐 Log Management in Security

- **SIM (Security Information Management)**
    - Long-term **storage, analysis, reporting**.
    - Historical data for compliance/forensics.
- **SEM (Security Event Management)**
    - **Real-time monitoring and alerting** of events.
    - Focus on immediate response.
- **SIEM (Security Information & Event Management)**
    - Combines SIM + SEM.
    - Centralized solution for **real-time monitoring + historical analysis**.

---

## ✅ Exam Tips

- **Syslog uses UDP 514** (by default).
- **Clients send logs → Server collects logs.**
- **SIEM = SIM + SEM.**
- **Logs provide visibility into traffic, warnings, and alerts.**
- Be ready to **match severity codes with meanings** on the test.

⚡ Sample Question:

*“A router logs a condition that requires immediate correction. Which Syslog severity level is this?”*

→ **Level 1 – Alert**
