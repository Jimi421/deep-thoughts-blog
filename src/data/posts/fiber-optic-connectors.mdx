# Fiber Connectors (CompTIA Network+)

### Common Connector Types

- **SC (Subscriber Connector)**
    - Square shape, **push–pull** design.
    - Secure, simple, widely used in telecom/datacenter.
    - Common in **single-mode** fiber.
- **LC (Lucent Connector)**
    - Smaller “little connector,” compact size.
    - Push–pull design.
    - Favored in **high-density applications** (datacenters).
- **ST (Straight Tip)**
    - Round, **stick-and-twist (bayonet)** style.
    - Durable, reliable.
    - Common in **multi-mode** fiber.
- **MTRJ (Mechanical Transfer Registered Jack)**
    - Compact, RJ-style latch.
    - Houses **both transmit + receive fibers** in one connector.
    - Often used in office LANs, space-saving installs.
- **MPO (Multi-Fiber Push On)** *(for completeness)*
    - Bundles many fibers into one connector.
    - Used in **high-speed datacenter backbones**.

### Connector Polish Types (reduces *back reflection*)

- **PC (Physical Contact)**
    - Slight curvature on the fiber face.
    - Least effective at reducing reflection.
    - Used in early digital/phone systems.
- **UPC (Ultra Physical Contact)**
    - Dome-shaped end face.
    - Better alignment, **lower reflection** than PC.
    - Used in broadband & general-purpose fiber.
- **APC (Angled Physical Contact)**
    - End face cut at **8° angle**.
    - **Best reflection reduction**.
    - Used in **high-bandwidth, long-haul, and critical systems** (ex: undersea cables).
    - Always **green connectors**.

✅ **Exam Tips**

- **SC = Square / push–pull**, **LC = Little / compact**, **ST = Stick & Twist**.
- **APC** = best reflection control, angled 8°.
- If you see **datacenter/high-density** → **LC**.
- If you see **old school multi-mode** → **ST**.
