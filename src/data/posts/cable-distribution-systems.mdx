# Cable Distribution Systems

Cable Distribution system: organized systme to connect the network‚Äôs backbone in MDFto the IDF and the ent user‚Äôs wall jacks. 

Demarcation point - location at which the iSP connection ends and the netowrk inftrastructure begins. 

ISP makes sure it works up tp that point. most often its inthe MDF 

MDF. - MAIN DISTRIBUTION FRAME - serves as the main starting point for all interior cabling that will be distributed theroughout the facility.  MDF  Is like the root of a . a small network can use one switch a lagrge newtor will need multiple switches. 

Cable tray‚Äôs- Unit or assembly of units that form a rigid structural system to secure the calbes and raceways used by the cables as they go across the building. 

Horizontal - Drop ceiling/under a raised floor. inside a cable tray. 

Vertical - Vertial cross-connect. - minimize the number crossing through florrs. normally only a trunk and edge routers. gouing up. 

Racks - Designed to hold varoius devises like switches, routers, patch panels, and servers to facilitate efficent space managemtn and easy access for onging network maintenance. 

2 -post rack - Designed with two vertical posts and used for ligher equipmet f-r path panels and netw rok cabeling in telecommunicatons setups. 

4- post rack Designed with 4 vertical posts enhances tability 

Wall-mounted - space saving solution used for smallern etwork equipmetn and is ideal fo enviorns with limited floor space for ousing peripherial network componets.  host‚Äôs edge switches. 

Intermetdiate distribution frames support the locations closest to it. go from main fraim to a given floor then the intermediate may serve as a main for that floor. 

Full cabinet rack / rack enclosure. - Fully enclosed rack with sides, doors, and a top that offers a secure and protected environment for high-valuse equipment.

Intermetdiate distribution frames support the locations closest to it. go from main fraim to a given floor then the intermediate may serve as a main for that floor. 

Patch Panel - Device or unite featuring a number of jacks for the use of connecting and routing cirtust for monitoring interconnecting and testng circuts ina. convenient and flexible manaer.

110 - Type of punchdown block for both voice an data applications that rely on cat 5 or newer copper-based networks. 

uses a punchdown tool. 

Always connect the wall jack‚Äôs cable to a patch pannel. 

Fiber distribution panel - uses fiber connectors like sc, lc,st or mtrj to make connections. 

computer is connected to the wall jack using a patch cable. The wall jack will have an rj45 and will have a punchdown block on the block. runs through the walls across the cable trays to the intermediate distribution frame, then it‚Äôs on the punchdon block on ta punchdown block, then connected to a switch. 

# **Cable Distribution System (CompTIA Network+)**

### Demarcation Point

- **Where ISP responsibility ends** and customer‚Äôs network begins.
- Usually located in the **MDF** (Main Distribution Frame).
- ISP guarantees service **up to the demarc**.

---

### MDF ‚Äì Main Distribution Frame

- **Root of the network cabling system**.
- First point where internal cabling begins.
- Houses main switches/routers connecting to ISP.
- Small networks: one switch may serve as MDF.
- Large networks: multiple switches/distribution systems.

---

### IDF ‚Äì Intermediate Distribution Frame

- Extends cabling from the MDF to different **floors/sections**.
- Serves as a ‚Äúlocal main‚Äù for that area.
- Connects to **edge switches** for end-user devices.

üëâ **Exam Tip**: MDF = building-level, IDF = floor/area-level.

---

### Cable Trays

- Rigid structures to support cable runs.
- **Horizontal trays** ‚Äì in drop ceilings or raised floors.
- **Vertical trays** ‚Äì trunk runs between floors (vertical cross-connect).

---

### Racks

- Hold switches, routers, servers, patch panels.
- **2-post rack** ‚Äì light equipment (patch panels, cabling).
- **4-post rack** ‚Äì stable, supports heavier devices.
- **Wall-mounted rack** ‚Äì space-saving, good for IDFs or small setups.
- **Rack enclosure (cabinet)** ‚Äì fully enclosed, secure, for high-value gear.

---

### Patch Panels

- **Front**: RJ-45 jacks (connect patch cables from switches/PCs).
- **Back**: **110 punchdown block** (terminates permanent runs from wall jacks).
- Provides flexibility, protects switch ports, and makes troubleshooting easier.

üëâ **Rule**: Always terminate wall jack runs to a **patch panel**, not directly to a switch.

---

### Fiber Distribution Panels

- Same concept as patch panels but for fiber.
- Use **SC, LC, ST, MTRJ connectors**.
- Provide flexible connection and testing points.

### Typical Cabling Path

**Computer ‚Üí Patch cable ‚Üí Wall jack (RJ-45) ‚Üí Permanent run in cable tray ‚Üí IDF patch panel ‚Üí Edge switch ‚Üí Uplink to MDF ‚Üí Core switch/router ‚Üí ISP (via demarc).**

‚úÖ **Rapid Review Q‚Äôs**

1. What is the demarcation point?
2. Difference between MDF and IDF?
3. What‚Äôs the purpose of a patch panel?
4. Which connector type is used on the back of copper patch panels?
