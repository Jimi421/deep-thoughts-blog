# IP Address Management (IPAM)

ipam - methodoloty and suite of tools used to plan, track, and manage IP address aspace in a network infrastructure. 

DHCP is automated, 

oversees the allocation and make sure that it matches the 

IPAM creates a systemateic and error resistant way to manage ip. checks for conflicts and ensures two are not on the same IP address. 

new vm will be assigned with a new hostname and ip that match. most IPAM can be used to manage and be used by cybersecurity teams. 

# IPAM (IP Address Management)

### Concept

- **Methodology + tools** used to **plan, track, and manage IP address space** in a network.
- Works alongside **DHCP** and **DNS** to ensure accurate, conflict-free assignments.

---

### Functions

- **Centralized oversight** of IP allocation.
- Prevents **duplicate/conflicting IPs**.
- Tracks **hostnames ↔ IPs ↔ MACs**.
- Automates **documentation** of IP usage (instead of static spreadsheets).
- Integrates with **DHCP** → ensures dynamic assignments match policies.
- Integrates with **DNS** → automatically updates hostnames with IPs.

---

### Benefits

- **Error-resistant:** reduces manual mistakes.
- **Efficient:** prevents wasted IP space.
- **Scalable:** supports growing networks (esp. with virtualization).
- **Security:**
    - Helps cybersecurity teams detect rogue or unauthorized devices.
    - Provides visibility into what hosts exist on the network.

---

### Example

- A **new VM** is spun up → DHCP assigns it an IP + hostname.
- **IPAM logs it automatically** into the inventory, ensuring no conflicts.

---

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- **IPAM = plan, track, and manage IPs.**
- Works with **DHCP + DNS**.
- Prevents **conflicts**.
- Valuable for **cybersecurity visibility**.

⚡Memory Trick:

**“IPAM = IP Address Manager” → Tracks every IP so no two hosts collide.**
