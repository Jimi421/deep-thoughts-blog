# Wireless Antennas

Wireless Antenna - device designed to send and recive radio frequency signals. 

omnidirectional antennna - desogned to transmit and recive wireless signals in all directions equally. default type for devices and wirells access points. 

unidirectional antenas focuses on a sindle direction to privide a more concentraded signal beam. like if you wnat to reach two buildings together. can be used to make a wireless point to point network. good for long and narrow coverage areas or a strong signal in one articual directions. 

Yagi Antennna - specefic type of diretional antenna that can provide high signal gains and use narrow beamwidth. best if you need to capture signal or send signals over a long distance. 

Selecting the right antenna ensures the network delivers storn gan dreiable connectiviyt tailored to the users needs. 

# Wireless Antennas (N10-009)

### **Definition**

- Device designed to **send and receive radio frequency (RF) signals**.
- Antenna choice affects **coverage area, strength, and reliability**.

---

### **Omnidirectional Antenna**

- **Default type** for Wi-Fi devices & APs.
- Radiates signal **equally in all directions (360°)**.
- **Best for:** General coverage in homes/offices.
- **Exam Tip:** Think "AP in the middle of the room → coverage everywhere."

---

### **Unidirectional Antenna**

- Focuses signal in **one direction** → stronger beam, longer range.
- Useful for **point-to-point links** or **long, narrow coverage** (hallways, building-to-building).
- **Example:** Two offices across the street connecting wirelessly.

---

### **Yagi Antenna**

- A **specific type of directional antenna**.
- Provides **high gain** and **narrow beamwidth**.
- Ideal for **long-distance connections** where precise targeting is needed.
- **Common use:** Rural areas, outdoor point-to-point links.

---

✅ **Must-Know Associations**:

- **Omni = all directions, default.**
- **Uni = one direction, point-to-point.**
- **Yagi = high-gain directional, long distance.**

⚡ Quick Flashcards:

- **Q:** Which antenna type does a standard AP use by default?
    
    **A:** Omnidirectional.
    
- **Q:** Which antenna is best for connecting two buildings across the street?
    
    **A:** Unidirectional (Yagi if long distance).
    
- **Q:** What does "gain" in an antenna refer to?
    
    **A:** Stronger signal focus in a given direction.
    

Cell phones use omnidirectional some antennas allow to connect a different antenna.
