# DOS and DDoS

Denial of Servise (DoS) Attack - occurs when one machine is continually flooding a victum with requests for services. now one machine is not powerul enough 

TCP SYN Flood - A specefic type of DoS attack where an attacker initates a session, but never completes the connection , continues to send the syn packets. server will send it to a spoofed ID, leaving the connetion half open. 

ICMP Flood (Smurf Attack) - occurs when an attaker pings a subnet broadcast with a spoofed source ip making the victimized server being exaused of resources. 

icmp floods re not as common as they used to be but could still be a iable attck methos for misconfigured network 

DDoS - Attacker may use may comouters at the same time asking for access to a single server. 

Botnet - collection of compromised computers. 

Zombie - single node controled in a bot net. 

c2 - command and control server

it’s harder as you move to the cloud. you can scale horizontaly. DDoS attacks should be preveneted even when using cloud-based resourses. 

# DoS & DDoS Attacks

### Denial of Service (DoS)

- **One attacker, one victim.**
- Floods a system with requests to exhaust resources.
- Less common today (single machine often not powerful enough).

---

### Types of DoS Attacks

- **TCP SYN Flood**
    - Attacker sends SYN packets but never completes 3-way handshake.
    - Leaves many **half-open connections**.
    - Server resources exhausted.
- **ICMP Flood (Smurf Attack)**
    - Attacker spoofs victim’s IP as source of ICMP echo requests (pings).
    - Sends to broadcast address → all hosts reply to victim.
    - Victim is overwhelmed by replies.
    - Less common today due to router configs blocking directed broadcasts.

---

### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

- **Many attackers (botnet) targeting one victim simultaneously.**
- Far more powerful than single DoS.
- Common in large-scale attacks (e.g., against banks, governments).

---

### Key Terms

- **Botnet** → Network of compromised devices (PCs, IoT).
- **Zombie** → A single compromised device inside a botnet.
- **C2 (Command & Control) Server** → Directs the botnet’s attack traffic.

---

### Mitigation / Considerations

- **Cloud scaling (horizontal scaling)** can absorb traffic, but DDoS can still overwhelm systems.
- Need **DDoS prevention/mitigation services** (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS Shield).
- Network devices should be configured to **drop spoofed or broadcast traffic**.

---

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- DoS = **single attacker**; DDoS = **multiple attackers (botnet)**.
- **SYN Flood = incomplete handshakes**.
- **Smurf = ICMP flood via broadcast spoofing**.
- **Botnet = collection of zombies, controlled by C2.**
- Cloud helps but **does not eliminate DDoS risk**.

⚡Memory Trick:

- **SYN Flood = Starts, Never Finishes.**
- **Smurf = Ping + Broadcast = Big Echo.**
- **Zombie army = DDoS.**
