# Layer 1 - (Physical)

Where transmission of bits across the network occurs. Includes the physical and electrical network characteristics. It is bits, 1 and 0. Yes and no on and off. If it’s a copper wire it’s 0 volts for 0 and .1 volts for 1. 

- Transition Modulation. If it changes during the clock ttime. if it changes during the cicle it’s represented as 1 if not is’s a 0.

The cables are a part of the physical network. The connete is wired is tepend on the standard

- crossover cables 568 A on one side and B on the other side.
- straight - through cables 568B on both sides.

Topology of the network: - Layer 1 devices view a network from a physical topology perspective. If you drew them out what pattern would it make. 

Data Syncrinization: - 

- acricinious syncrinizaiton: One can talk at a time, you do it and another person does it. Use a start and stop bit to indicaansmissions orccur from the sender to reciver. te when tr
- Syncrinious: If both are talking at the stame time. Uses a refrence clock to coodinate the transmissions by both sender and reciver.

How to use the bandwidth of the cable. 

Broadband: divide the bandwidth into separate channels. 

Baseband:sue all aailable frequencies all of the time. telephone. - uses a refrence clock. Wired home ethereth. 

Time - Division Multiplexing - each session takes a turn using the time slocs, to share the medium between all users. 

Statistical time-Division Multiplexing (StatTDM)- Allocates the time clots on an as needed basis. everyont takes turns based on the needs. 

Multiplesxing involves optimizing a limited amount of resources for more efficent utilization 

Multiplexing enables simultainius use of a base band connetion by multple users. 

Examples: 

Media: Fiber optic cable, Ethernet Cable, Coaxial cable

Wireless: Bluetooth, Wi-fi, NFC

Infrastructure: Hubs, Accesspoints, Media converters/ 

Layer 1 devices are just repeaters. 

## 🧱 **OSI Layer 1 — Physical Layer**

> Where raw bit transmission occurs
> 
> 
> Concerned with physical and electrical characteristics of the network — **1s and 0s**, on/off signals, voltages, light pulses, and radio waves.

### 🧬 **Core Concepts**

- **Bit Transmission**: Raw data (bits) is transmitted across physical media (copper, fiber, RF).
- **Signal Representation**:
    - On copper: `0` volts = binary 0, small voltage (e.g. 0.1v) = binary 1
    - Light (fiber) or radio signals may use different representations

---

### 🔄 **Transition Modulation**

- Interprets bits based on **changes in signal during the clock cycle**:
    - **Change = 1**
    - **No change = 0**

---

### 🔌 **Media & Cabling**

- **Part of the physical layer** (cables literally *are* Layer 1):
    - **Ethernet cables**
    - **Fiber optic**
    - **Coaxial cable**

### Ethernet Cable Types:

- **Straight-through cable**: Same standard on both ends (e.g. 568B ↔ 568B)
    
    Used to connect **unlike devices** (PC → Switch).
    
- **Crossover cable**: 568A on one end, 568B on the other
    
    Used to connect **like devices** (PC → PC, Switch → Switch).

### 🛰️ **Network Topology (Physical)**

- Layer 1 devices **only see physical topology**:
    - What shape would the network make if you drew out all the cables?
    - Examples: star, mesh, ring, bus.

---

### 🕰️ **Data Synchronization Types**

### 1. **Asynchronous Transmission**:

- Only **one party transmits at a time**
- Uses **start and stop bits** to indicate transmission boundaries

### 2. **Synchronous Transmission**:

- **Both sender and receiver share a reference clock**
- Enables simultaneous transmission and better efficiency

### 📶 **Bandwidth Usage**

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Baseband** | Uses the **entire bandwidth** for one channel. Example: Ethernet |
| **Broadband** | Splits bandwidth into **multiple channels**. Example: Cable TV |

---

### ⏱️ **Multiplexing (MUX)**

> Used to optimize limited bandwidth by allowing multiple signals to share the same medium.
> 

### Types:

- **TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)**:
    - Each session gets a turn in fixed time slots
- **Statistical TDM (StatTDM)**:
    - Time slots allocated **as needed**, more efficient
