### Options for Resolution

- **Repair**
    - Fix or replace components.
    - Compare **repair cost vs replacement cost**.

    - Swap device/system with newer model if cost is similar or benefits outweigh repair.
- **Workaround**
    - Temporary fix to restore service while a permanent solution is planned.

### Factors to Consider

- **Resources:** What tools, staff, or parts are required?
- **Time:** How long will the fix take? Any downtime?
- **Cost:** Budget impact (repair vs replace).
- **Potential Impacts:**
    - Service disruption.
    - Effect on other systems.
    - User/customer impact.
