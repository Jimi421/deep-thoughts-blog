# Step 4 — Establish a Plan of Action (and Identify Potential Effects)

After confirming the root cause, map out how to remediate it. A thoughtful plan ensures you choose the most effective option while safeguarding operations and stakeholders.

## Evaluate Resolution Paths

- **Repair:** Fix the existing component or configuration when the cost and downtime are justified.
- **Replace:** Install a new device or system if it delivers better reliability or similar cost compared with repairing aging hardware.
- **Workaround:** Implement a temporary solution to restore service while you secure resources for a permanent fix.

## Assess Resources and Constraints

- **Time:** Estimate the duration of the change, maintenance windows required, and any outage notifications.
- **People and tools:** Confirm the technicians, vendors, or equipment needed are available.
- **Budget:** Determine whether the fix fits within approved spending or requires management sign-off.

## Identify Potential Impacts

- **Service disruption:** Understand which business services, users, or customers will be affected.
- **Dependencies:** Consider downstream systems, integrations, or compliance requirements.
- **Risk and safety:** Evaluate security implications, health and safety requirements, and rollback strategies.

## Coordinate the Change

- **Follow change control.** Obtain approvals, document the remediation plan, and communicate timelines to stakeholders.
- **Schedule wisely.** Use maintenance windows or low-usage periods to minimize business impact.
- **Define success criteria.** Specify the tests that will confirm the fix worked and the checkpoints that indicate a rollback is necessary.

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- Step 4 is about **planning**—not execution.
- Compare repair, replacement, and workaround options before deciding.
- Always weigh **time, cost, resources, and impact** to avoid unintended consequences.

⚡ **Memory Hook:** *Plan = Option selection + Resource check + Impact review.*
