# Remote Access Ports and Protocols

Build an manage systems and networks from across the network. Allows admins and users to run progras from afar 

SSH : Secure shell - protocol used for secure remote logn over a secure netork. Operates over port 22. 

SSH is creating a secure encrypted tunnel that cna operate text based commands from a remote server. 

Telnet - Operates oer port 23, allows one computer to longin remotly to another computer. Telnet lacks encryption. SSH replaced Telnet. never use it. 

RDP: Propritary protocol that was developed by ‘Microsoft to provide users with a GUI to to connect to another computer over a network onnection. 3389 

data encrption smart card authentication, bandwidth reduction mechanisims. 

RDP and SSh are critical to managing modern networks. 

## What these do (in one line)

- **SSH (Secure Shell)** — secure CLI remote login/tunneling over **22/TCP**.
- **Telnet** — legacy, **insecure** CLI remote login over **23/TCP** (don’t use on real networks).
- **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)** — Microsoft GUI remote access over **3389/TCP** with encryption, smart‑card auth, bandwidth reduction.

### Must Know (Ports show up a lot)

- **SSH = 22**, **Telnet = 23**, **RDP = 3389**. (All listed under N10‑009 1.4 ports table.)

## Key Differences (fast compare)

- **Security**
    - SSH: **Encrypted** channel + strong auth.
    - Telnet: **Plain text** (credentials and data). **Avoid**.
    - RDP: **Encrypted** session; supports **smart cards** and **bandwidth reduction**.
- **Use case**
    - SSH: Admin CLI on Linux/Unix/network gear; can tunnel SFTP/port‑forwarding.
    - Telnet: Only for labs/legacy when encryption isn’t required (exam will flag it as wrong in prod).
    - RDP: Full **Windows GUI** remote control.

## Exam Tips

- **Ports**: If the question smells like “secure CLI,” pick **SSH/22**; “legacy CLI,” **Telnet/23**; “Windows GUI,” **RDP/3389**.
- **Security**: “Plain‑text remote login?” → **Telnet** (bad). “Encrypted remote management?” → **SSH** or **RDP** depending on CLI vs GUI.
- **Association**: **SFTP rides SSH on port 22** (often paired in questions).

## Memory Tricks

- **“22 is secure too (SSH)”**, **“23 is dirty (Telnet)”**, **“RDP has 3–3–8–9 windows”** (think Windows GUI boxes).

## Quick Checks (Common Questions)

- **Q:** Which protocol gives you a secure terminal into a router over the internet?
    
    **A:** **SSH (22)**.
    
- **Q:** A packet capture shows user/pass in clear text during remote login—what protocol?
    
    **A:** **Telnet (23)**.
    
- **Q:** Need full desktop on a remote Windows Server with smart‑card login—what/port?
    
    **A:** **RDP (3389)**.

## Flashcards (optional)

- **Front:** SSH default port
    
    **Back:** 22/TCP (secure CLI/tunnel).
    
- **Front:** Telnet default port + risk
    
    **Back:** 23/TCP; **plain text/insecure**.
    
- **Front:** RDP default port + two features
    
    **Back:** 3389/TCP; encryption, smart‑card auth (also bandwidth reduction mechanisms).

## 30‑Second Drill

- **SSH 22** ✅
- **Telnet 23** ❌ (insecure)
- **RDP 3389** 🪟 (GUI, encrypted)
