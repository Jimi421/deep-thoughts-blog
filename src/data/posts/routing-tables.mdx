# Routing Tables

Routing table helps detemrin which route tenry is the best fit for the network. 

Directly connected route - learned by physical connection between two routers. 

Static Route - manually configured by administrator 

default static route 0.0.0.0 “if you dont know where to go, jsut go here. 

Dynamic Route - learned by exchanging information between routers.

# Routing Basics (N10-009)

### **Routing Table**

- Holds all known routes to destinations.
- Router selects the **best match** (longest prefix match).
- Routes learned by:
    1. **Directly Connected Routes** – added automatically when an interface is configured and up.
    2. **Static Routes** – manually configured by an admin.
        - Example: `ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1`
        - **Default Static Route**: `0.0.0.0/0` → “if you don’t know where to send it, send it here.”
    3. **Dynamic Routes** – learned from other routers via routing protocols.

### **Dynamic Routing Concepts**

- **Split Horizon:** Prevents routing loops by disallowing a router to advertise a route back out the interface it learned it on.
- **Poison Reverse:** Instead of ignoring, router sends route update back with **infinite metric** (route cost = unreachable) to explicitly warn neighbors not to use that path.
- Both help prevent **count-to-infinity loops** in distance vector protocols (e.g., RIP).

✅ **Must-Know for Exam**

- **Directly connected = strongest (preferred first).**
- **Static = admin-defined, takes priority over dynamic if both exist.**
- **Default route (0.0.0.0/0)** = catch-all.
- **Split Horizon + Poison Reverse** = loop prevention techniques.

⚡ **Flashcard Drill**

- **Q:** Which route is automatically added when you configure an interface?
    
    **A:** Directly connected route.
    
- **Q:** What does `0.0.0.0/0` represent?
    
    **A:** Default route.
    
- **Q:** What prevents a router from advertising a route back the way it came?
    
    **A:** Split Horizon.
    
- **Q:** What sends back a route with infinite cost to avoid loops?
    
    **A:** Poison Reverse.
