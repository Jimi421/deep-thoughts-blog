# Copper Network Connectors

Each application uses may use different connectors. 

RJ = registered jack 

RJ - X Standardzedd telecomunition network interfact for connecting voice and data equipment to a service provided by a locl ecxhcnage carrire or long distance carrier. X is a place holder for 11, 45 ect. 

RJ - 11 

RJ -45 are for twisted pair. 

RG - X Radio Guide. Associated with coaxial cable for different applicaions like High speed internet, TV ect

RG-6 

RG-59 

RJ-11 - Standard connector for telephone wireing. 

6 position 2 condutior 2 2p2c, ideal for phone, not sutiable fro hgh speed intenrt. 

RJ-45 

Standard for data in ethernet

8 position 8 conductior. widley used to connect devices in a lan. Can support high-speed data transfers. 

F- Type 0 Standard for cable TV and coaxial . 

RG-6 USED FOR COAXIAL in resedintal and commercial settings, have a F type . can be used for digital TV high frequency, high speed internet services. 

RG-59 OLDER SPEC for coax cables, used to be very common for tv and radio signal transmiission. 

BNC Bayonet Neill Conceilmen - another type of coax connecter that is used to push and twisht style connector. quick, secure, reliable, stable. erroniously called british navil connecor 

# Cable Connectors (CompTIA Network+ N10-009)

### RJ (Registered Jack)

- **RJ-11**
    - **6P2C** (6 positions, 2 conductors).
    - Standard for **telephone wiring**, DSL.
    - Not suitable for Ethernet/high-speed data.
- **RJ-45**
    - **8P8C** (8 positions, 8 conductors).
    - Standard for **Ethernet (Cat 5/5e/6/7/8)**.
    - Used in LANs for high-speed data (100 Mbps ‚Äì 40 Gbps).

üëâ **Exam Tip**: RJ-11 = phones, RJ-45 = Ethernet.

### Coaxial Cable Connectors

- **RG = Radio Guide rating** (specifies thickness & impedance).
- **RG-6**
    - Modern standard for **cable internet & digital TV**.
    - Supports high frequencies, long distances.
    - Uses **F-Type connector**.
- **RG-59**
    - Older, lower bandwidth; used for analog video, CCTV.
    - Shorter distance support.
    - Also uses **F-Type connector**.

### Connector Types

- **F-Type**
    - Standard screw-on connector for **cable TV, broadband (RG-6)**.
    - Residential and commercial settings.
- **BNC (Bayonet Neill‚ÄìConcelman)**
    - **Push-and-twist (bayonet)** style.
    - Used for **coax in CCTV, older networking, test equipment**.
    - Provides secure, quick connect/disconnect.
    - Sometimes mis-called ‚ÄúBritish Naval Connector.‚Äù
