# Risk Management

Threats 

Vulnerabilites

combined for risk. When you’re ready to go to bed you lock the doors. 

Treats burgurlar, or wind and rain. 

vulnerabilities - unlocked doors, depend on the risk, if worried about burgurler, then yes lock all, if worried about wind maybe only lock the front door. 

Risk Assesment - process that identifies petential risks in a situation 

Seuity - used to ID access key security ontrosl within an applicion system or netowrk. 

Threat Assesment - focused on id THE different threats that are out there. Mitre attack framework is an example. 

Vulnerability Assesment - focused on identified quantiefying a vuln on a system, 

Nessus, QualysGuard, OpeVAS. 

Penetration Test - evaluates the secruity of an it INFRASTRUCTURE by trying to safely exploity vulnerabiliys. 

Posture Assesment - used to asses the originaztions attack surface. 

Define Mission critical componets 

Identify strgenths, weakenesses, and security isseus

Stregenthin position stay in control 

Buisness risk assesement - understand id potential risks in the buisness 

Process Assesment - diciplined examination of processes used by an orgizanation. are you doing the right things, and doing them the right way. After the assesment, there may be some recomendations. 

Vendor Assesment - Assement prosepective vendor to determine if they an effectively meeth the obligations and the needs of the buisness. 

Venders were sellinc counterfit CISCO devices ect… 

# Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risks

### Core Concepts

- **Threat:** Potential danger. (Ex: burglar, storm, hacker).
- **Vulnerability:** Weakness that could be exploited. (Ex: unlocked door, unpatched server).
- **Risk:** Combination of **threat + vulnerability**.
    - Ex: Burglar (threat) + unlocked door (vulnerability) = high risk.

# Types of Assessments

### 1. **Risk Assessment**

- Identifies **potential risks** to systems, data, or business processes.
- Considers **likelihood + impact**.
- Example: Deciding which doors to lock based on weather or burglary concerns.

---

### 2. **Security Assessment**

- Broad review of security controls (application, system, or network).
- Goal: Identify **access weaknesses** and improve defenses.

---

### 3. **Threat Assessment**

- Focuses on **external threats** that could impact the org.
- Tools: **MITRE ATT&CK framework**.

---

### 4. **Vulnerability Assessment**

- Identifies and quantifies weaknesses in systems.
- **Tools:** Nessus, QualysGuard, OpenVAS.
- Goal: Catalog vulnerabilities without exploitation.

---

### 5. **Penetration Test (Pentest)**

- **Active exploitation** of vulnerabilities to test real-world impact.
- Safely simulates an attacker.
- Goes beyond vuln scan by attempting to exploit.

---

### 6. **Posture Assessment**

- Evaluates the organization’s **overall attack surface**.
- Defines mission-critical assets, strengths, and weaknesses.
- Helps determine readiness against attacks.

---

### 7. **Business Risk Assessment**

- Focuses on **business operations** and risks (financial, reputational, operational).
- Example: Counterfeit Cisco devices entering supply chain = business risk.

---

### 8. **Process Assessment**

- Examines whether the org’s **processes are effective and efficient**.
- After assessment → recommendations for improvement.

---

### 9. **Vendor Assessment**

- Evaluates vendors to ensure they can **meet obligations and security needs**.
- Example: Screening for counterfeit hardware suppliers.

---

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- Threat + Vulnerability = **Risk**.
- **Vulnerability scan ≠ Penetration test** (scan = find, pentest = exploit).
- **Threat assessment = what could happen**; **Risk assessment = what’s the impact if it does**.
- Common tools: **Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys**.

⚡Memory Trick:

- **TV → R**: Threat + Vulnerability = Risk.
- **Scan = Look, Pentest = Touch.**
