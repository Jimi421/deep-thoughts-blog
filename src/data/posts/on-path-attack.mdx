# on path attack

on - path attack - where the attacker or pentester places their workstarion between two hot=sts to capture monitor and relay communiations. 

ARP poisioning 

DNS POISING 

ROUGE WIRELESS ACCESS POINT 

Replay - valid data is captured is repeteaded immetadly without dely. capture a handshake then redo it and it thinks we are the same. 

or relay - attacer is a proxy between the two hosts, can read and modify the info. put yourself inbetween the serve and the client and mix it up. 

SSL stripping redirecting HTTPs request to HTTP to bypass encryption. 

Downgrade - an attack in which the attacker attempt to have a clinet or server abandon ith higher security mode in faor of a lower security mode. that may allow the attacker to crack the encryption at a much lower level. but can be applied to any encryption or protection mechanianisim. 

# On-Path Attacks (a.k.a. Man-in-the-Middle, MITM)

### Concept

- Attacker inserts themselves **between two hosts** (client ↔ server).
- Can **capture, monitor, relay, or modify** communications.
- Often invisible to the victim.

### Common Techniques

- **ARP Poisoning** → Corrupt ARP cache so traffic flows through attacker.
- **DNS Poisoning** → Redirects users to attacker-controlled sites.
- **Rogue Wireless Access Point** → Attacker sets up fake AP, users connect unknowingly.
- **Replay Attack** → Captures valid traffic (e.g., handshake, login token) and resends it to impersonate.
- **Relay Attack** → Attacker proxies real-time traffic, can **read & modify** contents.
- **SSL Stripping** → Downgrades HTTPS to HTTP, bypassing encryption.
- **Downgrade Attack** → Forces weaker encryption protocol (e.g., from TLS 1.3 → TLS 1.0), making traffic easier to crack.

---

### Impacts

- Data theft (passwords, credit card numbers).
- Session hijacking.
- Unauthorized access.
- Loss of encryption and confidentiality.

---

### Mitigation

- **Encryption (TLS/SSL, VPNs)** → Prevents useful interception.
- **Certificate validation (PKI)** → Stops SSL stripping & downgrade attacks.
- **Static ARP entries / Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)** → Mitigates ARP poisoning.
- **DNSSEC** → Protects against DNS poisoning.
- **Wireless security (WPA3, disable open SSIDs)** → Prevents rogue AP use.
- **Replay protection mechanisms** (timestamps, nonces).

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- On-Path = attacker **between two parties**.
- **Replay = resend valid traffic. Relay = live proxying.**
- **SSL stripping = HTTPS → HTTP downgrade.**
- **Downgrade attack = force weaker crypto.**
- Mitigations = **encryption, certificate validation, DAI, DNSSEC, VPNs.**

⚡Memory Trick:

**“On-Path = Overhear, Replay, Alter, Strip, Downgrade.”**
