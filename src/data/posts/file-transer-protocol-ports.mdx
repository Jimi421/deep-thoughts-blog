# File Transer Protocol & ports

File transfer prots and protocols 

Specilaized rues and procedures that are utilized for the transmission of files across netorks, operate on deignated ports, and act as doorws for data trnasfer activietes. 

FTP: File Transfer Protocol - used for transferring data over the network. not encrypted but sent as plaintext. 

port 20 sending the data

port 21 sending control command.

SFTP - Secure file transfer protocol/ ssh file transfer protocol (secure ftp) 

Createc to address the iinsecurity of FTP. Tunnls FTP throuh an SSH connection which alreay has been encrypted. 

TFTP - Trivial file transfer protocol, simple more basic form of FTP and operates over port 69, it’s used when minimal security is succificent. 

SMB: Server message block operates over port 445 and allows computer apps to read and write to files over a computer network, used for windows file sharing. Works with Samba on linux also. 

SMB is used inside of local networks, and is not used to send data across the internet/ .

FTP port 20/21

SFTP port 22

TFTP port 69

SMB port 445

## 📁 File Transfer Protocols & Ports

> 🧠 Definition: Specialized rules and procedures that enable the transmission of files across a network. Each operates on designated ports, acting like “doors” for data transfer.

### 🔄 FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

- **Purpose**: Transfers files over a network
- **Security**: ❌ **Not encrypted** – transfers credentials and data in **plaintext**
- **Ports**:
    - `Port 21` → Control commands
    - `Port 20` → Actual data transfer

> ⚠️ Exam Tip: FTP is insecure! Avoid using it for sensitive data.

### 🔐 SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)

- **Purpose**: Secure file transfers
- **Built On**: **SSH**
- **Port**: `22`
- **Security**: ✅ Uses **SSH tunneling** – encrypted end-to-end
- **Not** the same as FTPS (which uses SSL/TLS)

> 🧠 Memory Trick: SFTP = Secure FTP over SSH → Port 22

### 🧼 TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)

- **Purpose**: Lightweight, fast file transfers (e.g., firmware, boot files)
- **Port**: `69`
- **Security**: ❌ Minimal to **no authentication**
- **Used for**: Simpler devices, PXE booting, VoIP configs

> ⚠️ Not used where authentication or encryption is needed.
>

### 🪟 SMB (Server Message Block)

- **Purpose**: Allows **file and printer sharing** over a local network
- **Port**: `445`
- **Used by**: **Windows** systems and **Samba** on Linux
- **Security**: Used mostly in **trusted local networks**, not designed for internet

> 🧠 Common Use Case: File sharing between Windows machines on the same LAN

## 📊 Port Reference Table

| Protocol | Port | Security | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FTP | 20 (data), 21 (control) | ❌ No | Basic file transfer |
| SFTP | 22 | ✅ Yes (SSH) | Secure file transfer |
| TFTP | 69 | ❌ No | Simple file transfers, PXE boot |
| SMB | 445 | ⚠️ Local only | File/printer sharing on LAN |

## ✅ Exam Review Points

- FTP is **not secure**, while SFTP **is**.
- TFTP is **lightweight and insecure**, used where speed matters more than security.
- SMB is **for internal file sharing**, not internet transfers.
- Know the **port numbers by heart**.
