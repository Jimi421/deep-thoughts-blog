# IPSEC

provides authentication encry[ton of packets to create an encrypted communicaion path between computers. 

Confiadentiality - encryyption

Integretity - hashing

auth a - verification 

anty replay - sequence numbers. 

main mode - conducts two three way exchanges. 

1 agree which algorithim wwill be used 

2 diffie helman exchange to generate shared key material to make the two keys 

3 verify the identy of the others by looking at encrypted form of ip address

agressive mode - fewer exhcnaes, resulter in fewer packets and faster initial connection vs main mode. 

use phase 2 key 

1 pc1 sends traffic to pc 2 

1 router 1 and router 2 negodiate security 

3 IKE phase 2 tunnel 

4 tunnel is established 

5 ipsec tunnel is torn down

Transport mode - useses packet origional pen header used for client to site vpns. when using a client to site use transport mode no aded packet. 

site to site - use tunneling mode - encapsulates the entire packet. increases size of the packet. 

AH - authenticatio header provides connectionless intregrity preventing replay attacks. 

ESP - encapsulationg security payload. - provides intregrity of the payload, 

in transport use AH to profived intregiryt for tcp header and esp to encrypt it 

in tunneling mode you can use both.
