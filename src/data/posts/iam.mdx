# IAM

Security process that proivides indification, authentication, and authorization for users and computers. Ideanty and Access Mangment 

Every unique subnect in an orginization has an account. 

personell - people, employees 

writing down usernames and passwords, logging in carelessly 

endpoints - desktops, laptops, tablets, cell phones. 

servers - have their own IAM mission crytical systems, encryption schemes. 

Software - can take info from users so needs it’s own way to allow or disallow. 

Roles - support the identies of various assest by defining the resource an accet is allowd to access. 

Identy and access management - directroy services repositories. access managemen tools, auding and reporting tools. 

create and deprovision accounts

manage accounts - reset passwords , update digital certs

audit accounts - big function in cyber security 

evaluate identy-based threats. check for weak passwords. 

maintain compliance .

Risk - 

user accounts - least risky 

privleged accounts - more risky has more permissions. administrator root, or super user. 

shared accounts - dangerous when it comes to audits. 

# Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### Concept

- **Security process** for **Identification, Authentication, and Authorization** of users, endpoints, servers, and software.
- Ensures the **right users/devices get the right access** at the right time.

---

### IAM Components

- **Subjects (Accounts):** Each unique entity (employee, system, service) has an identity.
    - **Personnel:** User accounts (employees, contractors).
    - **Endpoints:** Desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones.
    - **Servers:** Critical systems with IAM + encryption needs.
    - **Software/Apps:** Must authenticate to resources securely (APIs, services).
- **Roles:** Define what resources/accounts can access (role-based access control).
- **IAM Tools:**
    - Directory services (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP).
    - Access management tools (SSO, MFA).
    - Auditing & reporting tools.

---

### IAM Functions

- **Provisioning/Deprovisioning:** Create and remove accounts promptly.
- **Account Management:** Reset passwords, update digital certs, manage roles.
- **Auditing Accounts:** Critical for cybersecurity and compliance.
- **Threat Evaluation:** Detect weak passwords, excessive permissions.
- **Compliance:** Ensure policies, regulations (PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR) are met.

---

### Risks by Account Type

- **User Accounts:** Least risky, limited permissions.
- **Privileged Accounts:** Higher risk — admin/root/superuser accounts can cause severe damage if compromised.
- **Shared Accounts:** Most dangerous — hard to audit and trace activity, often against compliance rules.

---

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- IAM = **Identify, Authenticate, Authorize**.
- **Privileged accounts** are highest risk.
- **Shared accounts** are a compliance red flag.
- **Auditing + provisioning** = core IAM functions.

⚡Memory Trick:

**IAA → Identify, Authenticate, Authorize**.

Think: *“Who are you? → Prove it. → What can you do?”*
