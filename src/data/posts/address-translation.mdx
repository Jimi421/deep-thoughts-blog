# Address Translation

NAT -Network Address Translaton (NAT) 

Translates priavre ip address to public ip address for routing over public networks. 

DNAT - Dynamic NAT Automatically assigs an IP address from a pool and gives a one-to-one translation like if you shared keys to car with a group of people. 

SNAT - Manually assigns an ip address and gives one-to-one translation. 

PAT port address translation - sharing one public IP address by multiple private ip addresses which give a many to one translation . - 

Inside local - privae iP address. inside gloval private ip address refenced an outside 

outside global publice ip addess refrencing an outside device.

# NAT (Network Address Translation)

### **Purpose**

- Allows devices with **private IPs** (RFC1918) to communicate on **public networks**.
- Translates between **private ↔ public addresses**.
- Conserves IPV4 addresses.

## **Types of NAT**

### **Dynamic NAT (DNAT)**

- Uses a **pool of public IPs**.
- Each private IP gets temporarily mapped to one public IP (one-to-one).
- **Analogy:** “Borrowing a car key from a shared key pool.”

---

### **Static NAT (SNAT)**

- A **fixed mapping** between one private IP and one public IP.
- Always the same → often used for **servers** that must be reachable from outside.
- **Analogy:** “Each driver has their own permanent key.”

---

### **PAT (Port Address Translation)**

*(also called NAT overload)*

- Many private IPs share **one public IP**, differentiated by **port numbers**.
- **Most common type** (used in home routers).
- **Analogy:** “One car, many drivers; the system tracks who’s who by seat number.”

---

## **NAT Address Terms**

- **Inside Local:** Private IP of internal device.
- **Inside Global:** Public IP representing that internal device to the outside.
- **Outside Global:** Public IP of an external device.

### **Diagram (text version for memory)**

```
Private LAN (Inside Local)     Router/NAT       Internet (Outside Global)
192.168.1.10  ───────────────> [NAT] ──────────&gt; 66.51.41.112
192.168.1.11  ───────────────> [NAT] ──────────&gt; 66.51.41.112:1025
192.168.1.12  ───────────────> [NAT] ──────────&gt; 66.51.41.112:1026

```

- Here, **PAT** is in action: multiple inside locals mapped to a single inside global (public IP) with unique port numbers.

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- **Static NAT = fixed one-to-one.**
- **Dynamic NAT = pool one-to-one.**
- **PAT = many-to-one (common in SOHO).**
- **Inside local = private. Inside global = translated public.**
- NAT is critical for IPV4 conservation.
