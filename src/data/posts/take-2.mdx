# Take 2

## ❌ Missed Q20

**Scenario:** Monitor all traffic at gateway + block content types.

**Correct Answer:** **NIPS on internal + firewall on external**

**Why:**

- Firewall (external) = blocks malicious inbound traffic.
- NIPS (internal) = inspects traffic, can block based on content/signatures.
- NIDS = monitor only (no blocking).

**Exam Tip:**

> Firewall = first line defense.
> 
> 
> NIPS = *inside protection + filtering*.

## ❌ Missed Q25

**Scenario:** Adequate signal but intermittent connectivity + slow speeds.

**Correct Answer:** **Signal degradation or loss**

**Why:** Strength ≠ Quality. Noise, interference, or attenuation can corrupt frames.

**Exam Tip:**

> Strong but noisy signal = retransmissions = slow speeds.
>

## ❌ Missed Q45

**Flag to request TCP termination:** **FIN**

- **FIN** = graceful close (end of session).
- **RST** = immediate abort/reset.
- **SYN** = connection start.
- **ACK** = acknowledgment.

**Memory Trick:**

> FIN = Finished session, RST = Reset NOW.

## ❌ Missed Q53

**Windows tool to check route to host:** **tracert**

- **Windows** = tracert
- **Linux/macOS** = traceroute
- **ping** = connectivity only
- **ip** = interface mgmt on Linux

**Exam Tip:**

> tracert = Windows | traceroute = Linux/macOS.
>

## ❌ Missed Q57

**Wi-Fi with DFS + TPC (radar avoidance):** **802.11h**

- Required in Europe + radar-sensitive regions.
- DFS = Dynamic Frequency Selection.
- TPC = Transmit Power Control.

**Exam Tip:**

> Only 802.11h has regulatory compliance features.
>

## ❌ Missed Q77

**Authorized person knowingly lets attacker in:** **Piggybacking**

- **Piggybacking** = intentional.
- **Tailgating** = accidental (unaware).
- **Shoulder surfing** = spying screens.
- **Phishing** = fraudulent messages.

**Memory Trick:**

> Piggybacking = permission | Tailgating = tricking.
>

## ❌ Missed Q83

**Cable worked PC→PC but not PC→Switch:** **Crossover cable**

- **Crossover** = used to connect like devices (PC ↔ PC).
- **Straight-through** = unlike devices (PC ↔ Switch).
- **Rollover/console** = PC ↔ router console port.

**Exam Tip:**

> PC ↔ Switch = Straight-through.
>

## ❌ Missed Q84

**Protocol to avoid Layer 2 loops:** **802.1d (Spanning Tree Protocol)**

- 802.1q = VLAN tagging.
- RIPv2 = Layer 3 routing.
- OSPF = Layer 3 link-state routing.

**Memory Trick:**

> d = STP = Don’t loop.
>

## ❌ Missed Q87

**Router repaired in 4 hours:** **MTTR (Mean Time To Repair)**

- **MTTR** = repair duration.
- **MTBF** = avg time between failures.
- **RPO** = max acceptable data loss.
- **RTO** = time to restore service.

**Exam Tip:**

> Repair time = MTTR.
