# Zero Trust Archetecture

nroamly IT sec built a strong wall like a castle. But now those things are changing. normally using firewalls and ect. 

now we must protet the systems and data using encruyption. secure protocols, data-level authentication and other host based protecgion mechanisims. needed because of the cloud. 

Zero Trust - used to ensure the security of the corporate network and corporate ddata. 

“Trut nothing and verify everything” 

Zero trust verfication for every device user, and transation within a network regardless of its origin. 

control plane - framewowrk responsible for defining manaaging and enforcing the polices related to user and system access. 

data plane

Adaptive Identitey - relies on real tiem validation thtat takes into accounts behavour, device location, etc. 

Threat scope reducton - limit user’s access to only work-related tasks. 

Polidy - Driven Access control. - entails devoloping managing and enforcing user access policies based on their roles and responsigbilites. 

secured zones - isolated environs in a network for sensitibe data. 

control plane - layout 

subject systems - an individual or entitiy that’s attempting to gain access. 

Policy engine - cross refrence rules vs subject to see if able to be authroized. 

policy administrator - used to establish the access policies. 

the policy administrator and policy engine are the backbone 

policy enforcement point - where access descisions are executed. 

no user or system is trusted by default. 

# 🏰 Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)

**Old Model (“Castle & Moat”):**

- Strong perimeter (firewalls, IDS, VPN).
- Inside = trusted by default.
- Doesn’t fit cloud/mobile environments.

**New Model (Zero Trust):**

- *“Trust nothing, verify everything.”*
- Every **user, device, and transaction** must be authenticated and authorized, no matter where it originates.

---

## 🔑 Core Principles

- **Never trust, always verify** → all requests validated each time.
- **Least privilege access** → only what’s required for the role/task.
- **Microsegmentation** → break network into secured zones for sensitive data.
- **Strong authentication** → MFA, certificates, identity-based policies.
- **Encryption everywhere** → protect data in transit and at rest.

---

## 🛠️ ZTA Components

- **Control Plane** → defines, manages, and enforces access policies.
- **Data Plane** → handles the actual traffic flow.
- **Policy Engine** → checks rules vs. subject (user/device/transaction).
- **Policy Administrator** → establishes and manages policies.
- **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)** → executes access decisions at the resource.

---

## 🔐 Supporting Features

- **Adaptive Identity** → context-aware checks (behavior, device posture, location).
- **Policy-Driven Access Control** → role/responsibility based rules.
- **Threat Scope Reduction** → minimize what a user/system can touch.

---

## ✅ Exam Tips

- **Phrase to remember:** *“Never trust, always verify.”*
- **Backbone of Zero Trust** = **Policy Engine + Policy Administrator.**
- **PEP (Policy Enforcement Point)** = where decisions are enforced.
- **Reason for ZTA**: Cloud, mobile work, IoT → perimeter security no longer enough.
