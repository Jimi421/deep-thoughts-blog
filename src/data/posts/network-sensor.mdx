# Network Sensor

Temp -  most devices report on their own sensor. 

Temperature sensors can e used to measure intake and outake 

minor threshold - a rise in temp is detected. 

major threshold - the temp reaches a dangerous conditipon. device can start to load shed. 

cpu usage - under normal conditions cpu should hae minimal utilization in the range of 5%-40% 

high CPU can cause a router or deive to start to drop packets. 

misconfigured network 

network under attack. 

Memory utilization baseline 40% , busy 60% to 70% peak up to 80%

minor threshold 

severe threshold 

critical threshold

# 📊 Network Sensors & Monitoring

## 🌡️ Temperature Sensors

- Most devices (switches, routers, servers) have **built-in sensors**.
- Measure **intake vs. exhaust air**.

**Thresholds:**

- **Minor:** Temp rises above baseline.
- **Major:** Dangerous condition; device may **load shed** (reduce performance).
- **Critical:** Device may **shut down** to protect hardware.

---

## ⚙️ CPU Utilization

- **Normal baseline:** ~5%–40%.
- **High CPU** → device may **drop packets** or fail to forward traffic.
- Causes:
    - Misconfiguration.
    - Network under attack (DDoS, excessive traffic).

---

## 🧠 Memory Utilization

- **Baseline:** ~40%.
- **Busy:** 60%–70%.
- **Peak:** up to 80%.

**Thresholds:**

- **Minor:** approaching 60%.
- **Severe:** 70%+.
- **Critical:** 80%+ (risk of crashes or packet drops).

---

## ✅ Exam Tips

- **Sensors provide early warning signs** for overheating, high CPU, or memory exhaustion.
- Know difference between **minor, major/severe, and critical thresholds**.
- High CPU/memory can be caused by **attacks, misconfigurations, or failing hardware**.

⚡ Sample Exam Question:

*“A router begins dropping packets during normal traffic loads. Monitoring shows CPU utilization at 90%. What’s the most likely cause?”*

→ **Device is overloaded due to high CPU utilization.**

👉 Do you want me to also build a **baseline & threshold quick chart** (Temp, CPU, Memory side by side) so you can memorize normal vs warning vs critical values at a glance?
