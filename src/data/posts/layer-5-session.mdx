# Layer 5 (Session)

Conversation that is kept session from the tohers, it’s a 1 on 1 conversation b

Sesson Layer - keeps conversaitons separate to prevent intermingling of data. 

Set up : Checking of user credentials and assisngn gnumbers to assign to the session to help identify them. 

maintain : where data is transfered back and forth across the network.  

Transfer data, reestablish connetion if lost 

acknowledge recipt of data. 

tear down Session - ending of a session after transfer id done or when the other party disconnects. 

Layer 5 examples: 

h.323 - used to set up maintain and tear down video and voice calls. 

RTP- Real time transport protocol streaming audio/video (phone call or FaceTime Session)

Netbios- used to share fieles over a network. You see it a lot on networks. 

# 🔐 Layer 5 – Session Layer (OSI Model)

**Purpose:** Manages and maintains individual sessions between applications.

**Key Role:** Keeps **multiple conversations** separate and organized.

---

## ✅ Core Functions

| Phase | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Set up** | Authenticates user credentials and assigns a unique session ID |
| **Maintain** | Transfers data and can **reestablish connection** if interrupted |
| **Teardown** | Gracefully ends the session when communication is complete |

🧠 **Think: a private 1-on-1 phone call kept separate from other calls.**

---

## 🎯 Key Responsibilities

- Session **establishment, maintenance, and termination**
- Prevents **data intermingling** between multiple conversations
- Can **resume** sessions after brief interruptions
- Coordinates **dialog control** (half-duplex vs full-duplex communication)

## 🔌 Common Protocols at Layer 5

| Protocol | Use Case |
| --- | --- |
| **H.323** | Sets up, maintains, and tears down **voice/video calls** |
| **RTP** | **Streams audio/video** in real time (used in VoIP, video conferencing) |
| **NetBIOS** | Allows **file/printer sharing** over a LAN (common in Windows networks) |

> 💡 NetBIOS bridges communication between apps on separate machines.

## ⚡ Rapid Review Questions

1. **What does the session layer prevent?**
    
    → Intermingling of conversations
    
2. **What protocol sets up VoIP sessions?**
    
    → `H.323`
    
3. **Which layer reestablishes a connection if it drops mid-transfer?**
    
    → `Session Layer (5)`
    
4. **Which protocol helps with Windows file sharing?**
    
    → `NetBIOS`

### 💡 Exam Tip:

If the question is about **setting up, maintaining, or ending communication sessions**, it's Layer 5 — **not** the Transport Layer (which handles segmentation and delivery).
