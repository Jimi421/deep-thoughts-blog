RSSI recives signal stregenth indicator, powerlevel that th ereaio frequicnecy device is reciving. the further away the better. you should ss -60 to -57 means a strong signal and can support heavy . the closer to 0 the stronger the signal 

EIRP - Effective Isotropic Radiated Power - the maximum amount of power that could be raiated from an indeal intropic antenna given antenna gain and the transmitter power. 

dBi - destribuites out the power in all levels, tells how strong the power is being sent out of the AP. that is the signal sent. and tha can impact the EIRP.
