# Layer 2 (Data Link)

Data link layer- packages data into frames and transmits those frames over the network. 

Media Access Control (MAC) - Physical addressing system of a device which opperates on a logical topology. 

unique 48 bit physical addressing system to every network card that is produces. uses hexadecimal. D2:51:F1:3A:34:65 first 3 are the vendor code last three are the unique value

Layer 2 devices view the network logically. 

Logical link Control (LLC) - Provides a connetion cerices and aloows acknlwdgment recipt of messages. the most basic of flow control. Device can ask for replay send less if the dada is corrupted. it uses a checksum. 

layer 2 communicaton has 3 schemes

isochronus - network devices us a common refrence clock source and crate time slots for transmission 

Synchronous - network devices agree on clocking method to indicate begenning and ending of framed and can use control characters. Allows for begennig and end frames. 

Asyncrhonous - network devices refrence inernal clocks and use start and stop bits for synchronization. 

Devices: Network Interface Cards, Bridges, Switches. Ues logic to learn what ports are assigned to what mac addrss address. uging CAM tables and switching mechanisims across the network. 

## ðŸ§± Layer 2 â€” Data Link Layer (OSI Model)

> Purpose: Packages data into frames and transmits them across the network. Responsible for node-to-node delivery and error detection.

### ðŸ“¦ Layer 2 Sub-Layers:

### 1. **Media Access Control (MAC)**

- Responsible for **physical addressing**
- Uses a **48-bit hexadecimal address** (e.g., `D2:51:F1:3A:34:65`)
    - First 24 bits: **OUI** (vendor code)
    - Last 24 bits: **unique identifier**
- Operates on a **logical topology** (how devices appear to be connected)

### 2. **Logical Link Control (LLC)**

- Provides:
    - **Connection services**
    - **Acknowledgment** of frames
    - **Flow control** (basic form)
- Can request retransmission if the data is corrupted (uses a checksum)

### ðŸ”„ Layer 2 Communication Modes

1. **Isochronous**
    - Devices use a **shared clock source**
    - Data is sent in **predefined time slots**
    - Minimal delay and jitter
2. **Synchronous**
    - Devices agree on a **clocking method**
    - Frames are sent with **control characters** to mark beginning and end
    - More efficient than asynchronous
3. **Asynchronous**
    - Devices use **independent clocks**
    - Data sent with **start and stop bits**
    - Simple but less efficient

### ðŸ§  How Layer 2 "Sees" the Network

- **Logical topology**: Layer 2 devices view the network based on MAC addresses and port mappings (not physical layout)

### ðŸ”§ Layer 2 Devices

| Device | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **NIC (Network Interface Card)** | Sends and receives Layer 2 frames |
| **Switch** | Uses MAC addresses to forward traffic |
| **Bridge** | Connects two segments and filters traffic |
| **Access Points (APs)** | Operate at Layer 2 for wireless (also touches Layer 1) |
- **Switches use CAM tables** to track which MAC address is associated with which port
- **Bridges and switches** use **forwarding mechanisms** to decide where to send frames
