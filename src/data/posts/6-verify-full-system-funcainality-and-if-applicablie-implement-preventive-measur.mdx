# Step 6 — Verify Full System Functionality & Implement Preventive Measures

After applying the fix, ensure the environment is truly healthy. Verification protects against hidden regressions, and preventive work reduces the chance of seeing the same problem again.

## Prove the Fix

1. **Test comprehensively.** Validate connectivity, application performance, and any dependent services. Run through the success criteria defined in Step 4.
2. **Confirm with the user.** Have the requester or affected stakeholders reproduce their workflow and acknowledge resolution.
3. **Check adjacent systems.** Inspect logs, dashboards, and alerts to ensure no collateral issues were introduced.

## Implement Preventive Measures

- **Patch and update.** Apply firmware or software updates that address the root cause.
- **Harden configurations.** Adjust ACLs, enable redundancy, or tune DHCP leases to prevent reoccurrence.
- **Improve monitoring.** Add alerts, logging, or dashboards that will highlight early warning signs next time.
- **Document safeguards.** Update runbooks or knowledge base articles with new steps that should be performed proactively.

## Communicate Outcomes

- **Share the results.** Notify stakeholders that services are restored and outline any lingering risks.
- **Schedule follow-up actions.** Plan additional preventive projects if the permanent fix requires future maintenance windows.

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- Step 6 is about **validation plus prevention**.
- Always gain user confirmation that the system works as expected.
- Preventive measures include patching, configuration hardening, improved monitoring, and added redundancy.

⚡ **Memory Hook:** *Step 6 = Prove it works, then prevent it from breaking again.*
