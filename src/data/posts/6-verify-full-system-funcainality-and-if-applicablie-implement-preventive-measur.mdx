# 6 - Verify full system funcainality and if applicablie, implement preventive measures

# Step 6 — Verify Full System Functionality & Implement Preventative Measures

### Purpose

- Confirm the solution worked and that **all systems/services are back to normal**.
- Prevent the problem from happening again.

---

### Key Actions

1. **Verify System Functionality**
    - Test the fix thoroughly (connectivity, applications, performance).
    - Confirm with the **user/customer** that the issue is resolved.
    - Check related systems to ensure nothing else broke.
2. **Implement Preventative Measures**
    - Apply **patches/updates** if the issue came from outdated software.
    - Strengthen **configurations** (e.g., enable DHCP failover, tighten ACLs).
    - Improve **monitoring/logging** to catch early warnings next time.
    - Add redundancy or backups if lack of resilience was the cause.

---

### Example Scenarios

- Fixed a switch port → verify user can now access LAN and Internet.
- DHCP misconfig resolved → confirm all new devices get valid leases.
- If root cause was a missing patch → deploy patch enterprise-wide.

---

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- Step 6 = **Confirm success + prevent recurrence.**
- Always test after applying a fix.
- Preventative measures = patching, updates, monitoring, hardening.
