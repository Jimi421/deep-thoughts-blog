# Network Performance metrics

Network Performnce Monitoring. looking at overall end user performance to check network. 

latency - measure of the time it takes for data to reach its destination. 

bandwidth - maxum rate of data transfer across a given network at ideal conditions. 

Throughput actual amount as it is successfully transfered. 

jitter - varation in the delay of the packets causing an error in the connecction. speed up and slow down. caused by packet loss. 

the buffers can free up and can swiftly send the data. ensure network is uding QoS prioritisse 

# üìä Network Performance Monitoring (NPM)

**Purpose:**

Measures how well the network is performing from the **end-user perspective**. Helps identify congestion, misconfigurations, or failures.

## üîë Key Metrics

- **Latency**
    - Time it takes for data to travel from source ‚Üí destination.
    - Measured in **milliseconds (ms)**.
    - Example: High latency = slow video calls or lag in games.
- **Bandwidth**
    - The **maximum possible data rate** of a network link under ideal conditions.
    - Example: ISP plan ‚Äúup to 100 Mbps.‚Äù
- **Throughput**
    - The **actual data transfer rate achieved**.
    - Often lower than bandwidth due to congestion, errors, or overhead.
- **Jitter**
    - Variation in packet arrival times.
    - Causes choppy audio, frozen video.
    - Often related to **packet loss** or **buffering issues**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Performance Optimization

- **QoS (Quality of Service)**
    - Prioritizes certain types of traffic (e.g., VoIP, video conferencing) over less critical traffic (e.g., file downloads).
    - Reduces latency/jitter for time-sensitive apps.
- **Buffers**
    - Store packets temporarily to smooth bursts of traffic.
    - If buffers overflow ‚Üí packet loss.

## ‚úÖ Exam Tips

- **Latency = delay** (time).
- **Bandwidth = maximum capacity**.
- **Throughput = actual achieved performance**.
- **Jitter = inconsistent delay**, hurts real-time traffic.
- **QoS = prioritize voice/video traffic** to reduce jitter and latency.
