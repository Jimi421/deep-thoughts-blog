# 3 - Test the theory to determine the cause

Test our theory to see if what we think the problem is, try to fix it. if the thory does not work make a new theory. figure out what the next theory is. 

Thoery is confirmed 

Theory is not confirmed 

Lack of skill or authority “part cots $10k” .. or issue is with the group policy, we don’t work with the servers.

# Step 3 — Test the Theory to Determine Cause

### Purpose

- Once you’ve **formed a probable cause (Step 2)** → **test it**.
- Goal: **confirm or rule out** your theory.

---

### Outcomes

- **Theory Confirmed**
    - You’ve found the root cause.
    - Proceed to Step 4 (Establish a plan of action).
- **Theory Not Confirmed**
    - Form a **new theory** and test again.
    - Work through alternative hypotheses until resolved.

---

### Limitations

- **Lack of skill or authority**
    - Example: Issue tied to **Group Policy Objects** (server team’s responsibility).
    - Or the fix requires a **$10k hardware part** (outside your approval).
- If outside your scope → **escalate** to the proper team.

---

### Exam Must-Knows

- Step 3 = **Confirm or reject your theory.**
- If theory fails → loop back to Step 2.
- If confirmed but **you can’t fix** (lack authority/skills/resources) → **escalate**.

⚡Memory Trick:

**“Test → Confirm, Reject, Escalate.”**
