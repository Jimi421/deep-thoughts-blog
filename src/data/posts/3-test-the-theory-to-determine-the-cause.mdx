# Step 3 — Test the Theory to Determine the Cause

Once you have a working hypothesis, validate it. The goal is to prove that the suspected cause actually explains the symptoms—or to eliminate it and move to the next theory.

## Execute Controlled Tests

- **Start with reversible checks.** Swap cables, reboot services, or apply configuration changes you can easily roll back.
- **Gather metrics as you test.** Monitor logs, interface counters, or application dashboards to see how the system responds.
- **Keep a change log.** Note the time, action taken, and result so you can undo or escalate with confidence.

## Interpret the Results

- **Theory confirmed:** You have evidence that the change resolved the issue or reproduced the failure. Proceed to Step 4 to plan the fix.
- **Theory disproved:** Document the outcome, revert any temporary changes, and return to Step 2 to form a new hypothesis.

## Know When to Escalate

- **Skill or authority limits:** If the resolution requires access you do not have (e.g., modifying Group Policy, changing firewall rules, or purchasing expensive hardware), escalate to the appropriate team.
- **Risk considerations:** Stop and escalate if further testing could jeopardize production systems or violate change-control policy.
- **Communicate clearly:** Provide the work performed, evidence gathered, and recommended next steps when you hand off the case.

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- Step 3 is about **confirmation**: prove or disprove your theory.
- If you cannot confirm the cause, **loop back** and develop a new theory.
- **Escalate** when the fix is outside your authority, requires specialized skills, or impacts critical infrastructure.

⚡ **Memory Hook:** *Test → Confirm, Reject, or Escalate.*
