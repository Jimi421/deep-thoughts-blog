on site survey make sure to look at wha channels. 

on a 2.4 ghz use 1 6 11 to make sure you’re using the whole spectrum. 

use 1. 6. and 11 if using multiple access points ina long hallway, have 10 - j10% overlap so devices can handoff. 

if using 5g using a honeycomb. 

attenuation - redution of signal between the tx and rx can happen for too much distance, wall or other obstical. more noise in the environment. can happen iin the antenna’s cable or in the wave. to increase signal str, possibly increase the quality of the antenna
