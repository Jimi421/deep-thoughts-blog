# DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

Provides an ip address to every machine on the network and eliminates configuration errors. 

IP Conflicts happen when the sam IP gets assigned to multiple machines inside the same network. 

SCOP- a list of valid app addresses availabel for DHCP to assign. 

Discover- when a device joins is til ask. 

offer - ip address offered from the serfer

request - we take the address from the server 

acknowledge - set’s the lease up. 

ip adddress , subnet mask, default gatewa ip and DNS server are all configured. 

dynamic assignemt 

static assignemtn 

if a device can’t reach the DHCP serer if dhcp fails it will default to the alternate configs. appipa or static ip address. 

scope - subnet mask configured, default gateway configured, DNS server, and the lease time. 

DHCP Relay Fowrards DHCP packeets between host and server. only needed if they are not on the same subnet or network. you can have a relay work across other server.

DHCP oppersates using UDP . 

IP helper forwards several cinds of UDP broadcasts across the router. if the serve and requester are not on the same network will need the IP helper. 

# DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) (N10-009)

### **Purpose**

- Automatically provides **IP addressing and configuration** to devices.
- Eliminates manual errors and IP conflicts.
- Runs on **UDP ports 67 (server) & 68 (client).**

---

### **DHCP Process (DORA)**

1. **Discover** – Client broadcasts to find a DHCP server.
2. **Offer** – Server replies with an available IP from its scope.
3. **Request** – Client requests that offered IP.
4. **Acknowledge** – Server confirms and leases the IP.

**Configured Values (from DHCP scope):**

- IP Address
- Subnet Mask
- Default Gateway
- DNS Server(s)
- Lease time

---

### **Assignment Types**

- **Dynamic Assignment** → DHCP picks from the pool, lease can expire.
- **Static Assignment** → Admin manually sets IP on device.
- **DHCP Reservation** → IP is dynamically given, but always the same for a specific MAC.

---

### **Scopes**

- Scope = pool of valid IPs DHCP can hand out.
- Includes **subnet mask, gateway, DNS, lease time.**

---

### **Failures**

- If DHCP unavailable →
    - **APIPA (169.254.x.x)** self-assignment (Windows).
    - Or use preconfigured **alternate static IP.**

---

### **DHCP Relay (a.k.a. IP Helper)**

- Forwards DHCP packets between client and server **if not on the same subnet.**
- Router receives client’s broadcast → forwards as unicast to DHCP server.
- IP Helper can also forward other UDP services (TFTP, DNS, NetBIOS, etc.).

---

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- DHCP = UDP 67/68.
- **DORA = Discover → Offer → Request → Acknowledge.**
- Scope = list of assignable IPs + subnet/gateway/DNS/lease.
- **DHCP Relay/IP Helper** needed across subnets.
- **APIPA = DHCP failure fallback.**
