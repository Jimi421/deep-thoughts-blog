# Wirless Network Types

Ad Hod/ Independent Basic Service Set (IBBS) - Network where devices connect directly to each other rather than through a central access point. Peer to peer netowrk. 

Ad hod network does not typically provide internet access. 

It can be good for file sharing. 

Infrastructure wirless network - more organized setup whech devices are connected to the network therouh a wirelses access poijnt. 

Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) - Set of the mac addresses of the wireless access point. 

SSID (Service Set Identefier) : Common Alphanumeric name that users can use to serach for the network. 

Extneded Servece Set (ESS) 

Cresates a learget etwork that shares the same SSID to allow for eamless connectivity across a building. 

Point - to point wirelss networks - connect two disting locations over long distances over distinct locating using high-gain antennas. point to point are highly efficent and offer dedicated bandwidth between two points. 

Wirless Mesh Networks - versitle and resilient form of wireles snetworks 

self - healing capability 

large-scale deployments. 

Data can take any path it wants. 

1 ESS ocnfiguration in wireles snetworks that operates in infrastructure mode.  

2 involves multiiple types of wirless networks to provide users to all operation to provide service to end users. 

Inherent redundancy in a mesh network ensures that data can be reuted through alternate paths. 

Autonoumous Access point. Standalone device that contains all the intelligence to handle wireles snetworking funcitons indepeindetly. 

Lightwithgt acess point - multple access points connecting back to a centralized controller. 

# Wireless Networking Models & Terms (N10-009)

### **Ad Hoc / Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS)**

- Peer-to-peer wireless network (no AP).
- Devices connect directly to each other.
- **Pros:** Simple setup, file sharing.
- **Cons:** No central management, usually no internet access.
- **Exam Tip:** Remember "Ad Hoc = device to device."

---

### **Infrastructure Wireless Network**

- Organized setup with a **Wireless Access Point (WAP)**.
- Devices connect through the AP to the wired network and internet.
- **Most common in enterprise and home networks.**

---

### **Identifiers**

- **SSID (Service Set Identifier):**
    - Alphanumeric name of the wireless network (what you see when searching Wi-Fi).
- **BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier):**
    - The MAC address of the AP’s radio interface.
    - Unique identifier per AP.

---

### **Extended Service Set (ESS)**

- Multiple APs with the **same SSID** across an area (building/campus).
- Provides **seamless roaming** for clients.
- Example: Walking across a school campus, staying on "SchoolNet."

---

### **Point-to-Point Wireless Networks**

- Connects **two distinct locations** (e.g., buildings across a street).
- Uses **high-gain directional antennas**.
- Provides **dedicated bandwidth**, efficient for long-distance links.

---

### **Wireless Mesh Networks**

- Many APs interconnected.
- **Self-healing:** If one AP fails, traffic reroutes automatically.
- **Scalable** for large deployments (cities, disaster zones, military).
- Inherent **redundancy** with multiple data paths.

---

### **Types of Access Points**

- **Autonomous AP:**
    - Standalone, manages its own configuration and traffic.
    - Good for small offices/home.
- **Lightweight AP:**
    - Requires a **centralized controller** (WLAN controller).
    - Scales easily; used in enterprise environments.
    - Controller handles authentication, channel selection, and roaming.

✅ **Must-Know Associations for Exam**

- **IBSS → Ad hoc → no AP.**
- **BSSID → AP MAC address.**
- **SSID → Human-readable name.**
- **ESS → Multiple APs, same SSID, seamless roaming.**
- **Mesh → Redundant, resilient, self-healing.**
- **Lightweight AP → Controller-based.**
- **Autonomous AP → Standalone.**
