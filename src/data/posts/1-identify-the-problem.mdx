# Step 1 – Identify the Problem

### Gather Information

- Ask the user what exactly is wrong.
    
    *Example:* “The internet isn’t working.”
    
- Clarify **symptoms**:
    - Slow connection?
    - No connectivity?
    - Intermittent dropouts?
    - Error messages?

### Establish Baseline

- **Before vs. After:**
    - What was working normally before the issue?
    - When did it stop working?
- **Recent Changes:**
    - Any updates, patches, or configuration changes?
    - Any new hardware/software?
    - Has the environment changed (power outage, moved devices)?

### Scope the Issue

- Is the problem isolated (one user) or widespread (entire office)?
- Check if neighbors, coworkers, or others in the area are affected.
- Determine if it’s **user error**, **environmental**, or **system/software related**.

### Troubleshooting Questions

- What happened right before the problem occurred?
- Has this issue happened before?
- Has anything been replaced recently (cables, routers, NICs)?
- Have you tried anything to resolve it (restart, reset, cable swap)?

### Data & Safety

- Perform **backups** before making system changes.
- Document what you observe, even if it seems small.

✅ **Exam Tip:** On the test, expect “first step” troubleshooting questions — the answer is usually **gather information** rather than immediately fixing or replacing hardware.
