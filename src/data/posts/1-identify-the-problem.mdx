# Step 1 – Identify the Problem

Troubleshooting always starts with disciplined discovery. Before you change anything, capture a clear picture of what the user is experiencing, what has changed, and how widespread the disruption might be.

## Gather the Story

- **Clarify the symptoms.** Ask the user to describe exactly what is happening (for example, *“The internet will not load on any browser.”*).
- **Capture timing details.** When did the issue begin? Has it happened before? Is it intermittent or constant?
- **Collect environment data.** What applications, devices, or locations are affected? Are other users or departments seeing the same problem?

## Establish the Baseline

- **Before vs. after.** Document what worked prior to the incident and what changed immediately afterward.
- **Recent changes.** Note software updates, new hardware, configuration modifications, or environmental events (power outage, moves, construction).
- **User actions.** Determine whether the user attempted any self-remediation, such as rebooting gear or swapping cables.

## Scope the Impact

- **Isolate the audience.** Identify whether the problem affects a single endpoint, an entire VLAN, a site, or remote clients only.
- **Check dependencies.** Validate upstream services (ISP status, cloud provider health dashboards, or SaaS outage notices) to understand whether the root cause might be external.

## Collect Objective Data

- **Inspect and listen.** Look for link lights, warning LEDs, fans that are not spinning, unusual noises, or burning smells.
- **Review logs and monitors.** Export relevant entries from event logs, syslog, or monitoring dashboards while the symptoms are present.
- **Preserve evidence.** Take screenshots or gather error codes so nothing is lost once remediation begins.

## Protect the Environment

- **Back up first.** Capture configurations, system state, or critical data before applying changes.
- **Document findings.** Write down the questions asked, the answers received, and any assumptions you make so later steps stay grounded in facts.

✅ **Exam Tip:** When a question asks for the *first* troubleshooting action, the correct response is almost always to **gather information** before swapping hardware or reconfiguring devices.
