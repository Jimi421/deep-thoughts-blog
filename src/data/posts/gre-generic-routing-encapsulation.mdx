# GRE Generic routing encapsulation

Tunneling protocol used to encsuplte a wide varity of network layer protocols inside a virtual point to point network. 

universal translator when connecign similar network topologies over a network.

# GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation)

### **Definition**

- A **tunneling protocol** that encapsulates a wide variety of **Layer 3 protocols** inside virtual point-to-point links.
- Think of it as a **universal translator** for networks → allows different or similar network topologies to interconnect over an IP network.

---

### **Key Features**

- **Encapsulation only** → GRE does **not provide encryption or confidentiality** (must pair with **IPsec** if security is required).
- Supports **multicast, broadcast, and non-IP protocols** across IP networks (unlike many VPNs).
- Provides a **virtual point-to-point connection** between routers.
- Commonly used for:
    - Site-to-site tunnels
    - VPNs needing multicast (e.g., routing protocol traffic)
    - Interconnecting remote offices with different topologies

---

### **Advantages**

- **Versatility:** Can encapsulate many protocols.
- **Integration:** Works with existing IP infrastructure.
- **Flexibility:** Often layered with IPsec for secure, encrypted tunnels.

✅ **Must-Know for Exam**

- GRE = **encapsulation, not encryption**.
- Used as a **universal translator** to tunnel different network protocols.
- Often paired with **IPsec** → “GRE over IPsec” for secure site-to-site VPNs.
- Supports **multicast & broadcast** (important for routing protocols).

⚡ Flashcards

- **Q:** What does GRE provide?
    
    **A:** Encapsulation of many protocols, point-to-point tunneling.
    
- **Q:** Does GRE encrypt traffic?
    
    **A:** No (needs IPsec for security).
    
- **Q:** Why is GRE often used with routing protocols?
    
    **A:** Because it supports multicast/broadcast.
