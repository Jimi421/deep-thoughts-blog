# Training and Exerscises

Table top exersices - exersixes taht use an incident or scenerisos against a red team. simulate emergency sitaion and security events. 

penetration test - test that uses active tools and security utilities to evaluate securty by simulating an attack on a system to verity that a therat exists, activly test it, bypass security controls, and they finally exploit vulnerabilityes on a given syatem. test the system to discover vulns and identefy any logical weakensses, interview personesll. must be properly scoped and resources.. what will be tested. 

internal team, or external team. 

use red team vs system administrators. 

comp tia pentest + . 

redteam - hostile or atticking team in a penetration test. 

blue team - defensive test - network admins, cyber security admins. - 

white tam - staff evaluating and supervising a penetration test or incident response. 

# Training & Exercises

### Tabletop Exercises

- **Discussion-based simulation** of incident scenarios.
- Walk through response plans, roles, and decisions.
- No live systems are attacked.
- Goal: **test readiness, coordination, and communication**.

---

### Penetration Testing (Pentest)

- **Active test** using tools/utilities to simulate an attack.
- Steps:
    1. **Discover vulnerabilities**.
    2. **Verify** they exist.
    3. Attempt to **bypass controls**.
    4. **Exploit vulnerabilities** (within scope).
- Must be **properly scoped and resourced**.
- May include interviews with personnel to test social/operational security.
- Teams:
    - **Red Team** → Attackers/penetration testers.
    - **Blue Team** → Defenders (admins, security staff).
    - **White Team** → Supervisors/evaluators ensuring safety, rules, and scope.
- Can use **internal** or **external** testers.
- Related certification: **CompTIA PenTest+**.

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- **Tabletop = simulated discussion, no systems touched.**
- **Pentest = active exploitation.**
- **Red = attack, Blue = defend, White = oversee.**
- Pentest must have a **clear scope and authorization**.

⚡Memory Trick:

- **“Red Attacks, Blue Defends, White Oversees.”**
- **Tabletop = Talk; Pentest = Act.**
