# When to automate and orchestrate

streamline complex process 

enhance security 

improve efficenccy 

complexity - the initial step in assising the complexity and resource to commit it to automation. or orchestration. the more complex the task the more likley you need to orchestrate. 

cost - requires.a large upfront initial invesment to hire a service provider or a team of developes for implementaiton. harware,software,personell, ongoing support. 

begin with a manuall process, gradually automate at a lower cost untill a full orchestrated solution is available. 

single points of failure - id during automation or orchestration implemention in a network. 

Redundenccy - backup systems or manuall processes to ensure contintunity.

technical debt - can accumilate if not regurlayy maintained or updated. the cost of complexity of poorley implementated software needing action. 

regurlay review automation and orchestarton sysems to help reduce technical debt. 

ongoing supportability - long term supportability is crucilal for adapting automation 

automation depends on the connecdtons of systems vis APIs and webhooks. 

as the apis change you have to update your codebase to match. 

use for repeatable and stable tasks. 

one off- task highly variable task frequently changing tasks. . don’t automate it. 

# ⚙️ Automation & Orchestration

## 🎯 Benefits

- **Streamline complex processes** → less manual work.
- **Enhance security** → consistent enforcement of rules.
- **Improve efficiency** → faster, fewer errors.

## 📊 Key Considerations

- **Complexity**
    - Assess task difficulty before automating.
    - **Simple, repeatable tasks → automation.**
    - **Complex, multi-step processes → orchestration.**
- **Cost**
    - High upfront investment: hardware, software, personnel, service providers.
    - Best practice: start with **manual → partial automation → orchestration**.
- **Single Points of Failure**
    - Identify where automation may centralize risk.
    - Add **redundancy/manual fallback** for continuity.
- **Redundancy**
    - Ensure backup systems or manual processes exist if automation fails.
- **Technical Debt**
    - Poorly implemented automation = costly to maintain later.
    - Regularly review & update to prevent outdated/fragile code.
- **Supportability**
    - Automation relies on **APIs/webhooks**.
    - APIs change → codebase must be updated.
    - Long-term support is critical.

## 🚫 When *Not* to Automate

- **One-off tasks**.
- **Highly variable tasks**.
- **Frequently changing processes**.
- Better left as **manual processes**.

## ✅ Exam Tips

- **Automation** = repeatable, consistent, low-variation tasks.
- **Orchestration** = coordinating multiple automated tasks across systems.
- Always consider **cost, redundancy, complexity, and technical debt** before automating.
