# Understanding SIEMS

SIEM - Security Information Event Managemt (SIEM) - Provides real-time or near-real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardward and applications. 

Cybersecurity Analysts 

System Administrators 

Network Administrators 

conducting log reviews should be something that’s done regurly and routienly 

SIEM - combines 

log collection - provides important forensic tools and helps address compliance reporting .

normalization - maps log messages into a common data model, enabling the orginizaton 

coorelaiton - links the logs and events from different systems into a data fee 

aggregration - reduces the volum by merging them 

reporting - prevents the coorilated aggragated data in real-time monitirng in dashboards for analysts, or reports. 

Software 

Hardwar 

managed service 

1 log all relevent events and filter out 

2 establish and document the scope of events 

3 develop use cases to devine a threat. 

4 plan incident responces for given scenarios or events 

5 establish a tickiting process to track all the flagged events

6 schedule regular threat hunting with cybersecurity aynalists 

7 provide auditors and analysts an evidence trail. 

# SIEM (Security Information & Event Management)

### Purpose

- **Collects, normalizes, correlates, and aggregates logs/events** from multiple network devices, servers, and applications.
- Provides **real-time or near real-time analysis** of security alerts.
- Helps with **incident response, compliance, and forensic analysis**.

**Exam Tip**: SIEM is both **reactive (alerts)** and **proactive (threat hunting, log review)**.

---

### Functions

1. **Log Collection** – Pulls logs from devices/services (via **Syslog UDP 514 by default**, can also use TCP for reliability).
2. **Normalization** – Converts logs into a **common data model** for easier comparison.
3. **Correlation** – Links related events from multiple systems (e.g., same IP failing multiple logins across devices).
4. **Aggregation** – Reduces event volume by merging duplicates/similar events.
5. **Reporting & Dashboards** – Presents alerts, KPIs, and compliance reports.

---

### Deployment Models

- **Software-based** (installed on servers)
- **Hardware appliances** (turnkey SIEM boxes)
- **Managed services** (outsourced SIEM/SOC providers)

---

### Use Cases

- Detect brute force attacks, malware infections, insider threats.
- Compliance (HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, etc.).
- Forensics (audit trails for investigators).
- Threat hunting by analysts.

---

### Best Practices

1. **Log all relevant events** (firewalls, IDS/IPS, servers, endpoints).
2. **Document scope** – Decide which events matter (not everything).
3. **Develop use cases** – Define what “suspicious” looks like (e.g., multiple failed logins, data exfiltration).
4. **Plan incident responses** – Predefine actions for common alerts.
5. **Ticketing system** – Track alerts until resolved.
6. **Routine log reviews** – Analysts should regularly review and tune rules.
7. **Auditor trail** – Ensure logs are stored, timestamped, and tamper-proof.

---

### Common Ports

- **Syslog** → UDP 514 (default), TCP 514 (reliable)
- **Alternative syslog port** → TCP 1468 (secure/optional)

---

### Example Workflow

1. Firewall sends logs → Syslog server.
2. SIEM **collects & normalizes**.
3. SIEM **correlates events** (e.g., login from Russia + data download = alert).
4. Analyst sees alert on dashboard → opens a **ticket** → begins **incident response**.

✅ **Must Know for Exam**

- SIEM = Log collection + Normalization + Correlation + Aggregation + Reporting.
- Syslog default port **UDP 514** (but can be TCP).
- SIEM is used by **Cybersecurity Analysts, System Admins, and Network Admins**.
- Key feature: **real-time monitoring and compliance evidence**.
