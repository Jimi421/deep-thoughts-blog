# DNS - DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM

Converts a hostname to an ip address and an ip address to a hostname. DNS is an embedded part of networks and systems. You can set up your own DNS server to have your own domain name and hostname resolution. 

Fully-Qualified Domain Name FQDN a domanin name is witha top level provider .com 

[www.jimi421.com](HTTP://www.jimi421.com) domain name is jimi421 top level domain is .com if you have ftp. blog. .jimi ect will create the fully qualified domain. there are 5 layers. 

5 evels 

root. 

top level domain .com .net 

second level domain [jimi421.com](HTTP://jimi421.com) 

sub domain [blog.jimi421.com](HTTP://blog.jimi421.com) 

host rasberri-pi.home.jimi421.com

url has the full with the HTTPs:// 

Host file - a text fiel that servs as the first point of contact when a device wants to communicat with another device on the internet. hosts will check here first. 

A  i p v 4

AAAA - ip v 6 

cname - points to another domain 

mx -  mail exchange record. 

start of authortiy sores important info like zone transfer, which uses TCP. 

reverse DNS lookup. 

internal DNS is popular with cloud computing. 

DNS uses recursive lookup, keeps workig up to the root to ask. 

DNS Security - if you cna change the ip address in the DNS records hten you can cpaute the traffic and keep the login data, and redirect to the correct place. 

DNS Serucity excentions - provides a digital tamper proof seal for DNS 

DNS ofver HDDPs DoH - used to sedn DNS through the HTTPS protocol . 

DNS over TLS (

jplaces DNS throuh a TLS tunnel. 

# Domain Name System (DNS) — Exam Notes

### Purpose

- Converts **hostnames ⇄ IP addresses**
- Embedded in all networks and systems
- Uses **port 53**
    - UDP for queries (small messages)
    - TCP for zone transfers/large messages

---

### DNS Hierarchy (5 Levels)

1. **Root** – “.” (the invisible dot at the end of all FQDNs)
2. **Top-Level Domain (TLD)** – .com, .net, .org, .edu, country codes (.uk, .jp)
3. **Second-Level Domain** – e.g., `jimi421.com`
4. **Subdomain** – e.g., `blog.jimi421.com`
5. **Host** – e.g., `raspberry-pi.home.jimi421.com`

**FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)** = Host + Domain + TLD (e.g., `www.jimi421.com`)

---

### Records

- **A** – maps hostname → IPV4
- **AAAA** – maps hostname → IPV6
- **CNAME** – alias; points one name to another
- **MX** – mail exchanger (email delivery)
- **PTR** – reverse lookup (IP → hostname)
- **SOA** – Start of Authority; holds zone info (admin contact, refresh time, etc.)
- **NS** – identifies authoritative name servers
- **TXT** – human/machine-readable text (used for SPF, DKIM, domain verification)

---

### Other Key Concepts

- **Hosts file** – local text file, checked *before* DNS.
- **Recursive Lookup** – DNS server queries other servers until answer found.
- **Iterative Lookup** – DNS server gives referral to another server.
- **Zone Transfer** – copy of DNS database (TCP).
- **Internal vs External DNS** – internal for private networks/cloud, external for internet.

---

### Security

- **DNS Poisoning / Spoofing** – attacker changes DNS records to redirect traffic.
- **DNSSEC** – cryptographic signatures; verifies authenticity (not encrypted, just signed).
- **DNS over HTTPS (DoH)** – encrypts DNS in HTTPS traffic.
- **DNS over TLS (DoT)** – encrypts DNS in a TLS tunnel.

---

### Exam Tips

- **Port 53** = DNS
- **Zone transfers** = TCP
- **Queries** = UDP (unless too large)
- **DNSSEC** = authenticity, not encryption
- **DoH/DoT** = encrypt queries for privacy

---

✅ **Common Question:**

*“Which record type is used for reverse lookups?”* → **PTR**

*“Which protocol does DNS use for zone transfers?”* → **TCP**

*“Which protocol does DNS use for queries?”* → **UDP (port 53)**

---

Flashcard Trick: **A → Address (IPV4), AAAA → IPV6 (4 A’s = 4x bigger), CNAME → Canonical Name, MX → Mail Exchange, PTR → Pointer (reverse).**
