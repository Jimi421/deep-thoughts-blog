# Layer 7 (Application)

Application layer - Provides application-level serveces where users communicate with the computer.

It’s more lower level applications

File transfer, network transfer

Application Services

Service advertisement

Application services - unites communiating componets from more than one application.  

POP3, IMAP, SMTP

Service Advertisemet: Send out an annoucements to other devices on the network to state the services they offer. printers will let other devices know that they print. 

examples: 

Emai applications, pop3, imap, smtp

Web browsing: HTTP, HTTPs

DNS

FTP

Remote Access: Telnet, SSH, sntp

# 🖥️ Layer 7 – Application Layer (OSI Model)

**Purpose:** Provides **application-level services** that allow **user interaction with the network**.

**Think:** This is where **apps like email, web browsers, FTP clients** operate.

## ✅ Core Functions

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Application Services** | Enables communication between apps on different devices |
| **Service Advertisement** | Devices announce available services (e.g., a printer broadcasting availability) |

> 🧠 This layer doesn’t mean apps like Word or Photoshop — it refers to network-aware services used by those apps.

## 📡 Common Layer 7 Protocols

| Service Type | Protocols |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | `POP3`, `IMAP`, `SMTP` |
| **Web Browsing** | `HTTP`, `HTTPS` |
| **File Transfer** | `FTP`, `TFTP` |
| **Remote Access** | `Telnet`, `SSH` |
| **Directory/Name** | `DNS`, `LDAP` |
| **Time Sync** | `SNTP`, `NTP` |

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Application Services**: Bridges components between **multiple applications**
    
    (e.g., your email client using SMTP to send and IMAP to receive).
    
- **Service Advertisement**:
    
    Devices broadcast the services they offer
    
    > 📌 E.g., a network printer announces it’s available to print.

## 🧠 Memory Trick

> “Application = Apps Talk”
> 
> 
> It's where **network-enabled apps** talk to one another over standard protocols.
