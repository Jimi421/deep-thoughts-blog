# Address Resolution Protocol Attacks

ARP - used to match an IP address to a MACA ddress 

ARP Spoofing - an attack where an attacker sends falsifed arp messages ofer a lan. link the MAC address of the attacker to the legit ip address of a network resource. arp spoofing can be used to do on -path 

ARP POISONING - an attack that corrupts the arp cache (ARP table) in the network. 

ARP Spoofing more targeting attack 

Arp Poising targets all devices in a LAN

Data interception - if the ip is matches. 

on - path attack - intercepts without the partys knowledge. 

Network disruption

Scnn for an IP-MAC pairs and sending fake arp responses with a tool. 

conducting an ARP poising by conductin and arp flood 

use ARP oniotoring tools to track arp ADDRESS MAPPING 

alert network adming sof unusiual arp traffic patterns 

use IDS 

Static arp enteires - manually inputting arp mappings to preent spoofing. 

Dynamic Arp inspection -switches inspect ARP packets, dropping suspicious mapping based on trused map ip pairs 

network segmentation - using VLANs ect lowers brodcast domaings. 

vpn and encrypton - safeguards against reading the data even if susscesefiol. 

# ARP Attacks (Address Resolution Protocol)

### Purpose of ARP

- Maps **IP address → MAC address** on a LAN.
- Stored in local ARP cache/table.

---

### ARP Spoofing

- Attacker sends **fake ARP replies** to a victim.
- Maps attacker’s MAC to a **legitimate IP** (like the gateway or server).
- Used for **targeted on-path (MITM)** attacks → attacker intercepts victim’s traffic.

---

### ARP Poisoning

- Broader version: corrupts ARP caches of **multiple hosts** on the LAN.
- Attacker associates their MAC with many IPs → traffic is redirected.
- Often done by **ARP flooding**.
- Can disrupt the entire LAN.

---

### Impacts

- **Data Interception** → attacker can read/modify traffic.
- **On-Path Attacks** → attacker invisibly relays traffic between hosts.
- **Network Disruption** → corrupted ARP tables break connectivity.

---

### Tools / Methods

- Attackers scan for IP-MAC pairs, then inject **fake ARP responses**.
- Tools: Ettercap, Cain & Abel, arpspoof.

---

### Mitigation

- **ARP Monitoring Tools:** Detect unusual IP–MAC mappings.
- **IDS/IPS:** Alert on suspicious ARP traffic.
- **Static ARP Entries:** Hard-code mappings for critical devices.
- **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI):** Switches validate ARP against trusted IP–MAC bindings.
- **Network Segmentation (VLANs):** Reduce broadcast domains, limit scope.
- **Encryption (VPN/SSL):** Even if intercepted, traffic is unreadable.

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- **ARP Spoofing = Targeted MITM.**
- **ARP Poisoning = Broad LAN disruption.**
- Both rely on **sending fake ARP replies**.
- **Defense = DAI, static entries, monitoring, VLANs, encryption.**

⚡Memory Trick:

**“Spoof = Single Target. Poison = Poison the whole LAN.”**
