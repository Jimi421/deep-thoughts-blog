# Routing Redundancy Protocol

Network Protocol that prevents disruptions in communiton by automatically rerougin data traffic in case of a path or device failure. 

First hop reduncdancy protocy - set of protocols to provide automatic failover to another router. 

FHRPS are available  to determine if the first hop failed. 

Reliablilyt ensure that communications remain up and running even if. asingle router configuration failes. 

load balancing - distributes network traffic across multiple rouers to prevent any single device to be overwhelmed 

seamless translitions - sends data from a failed router to a redireded standbuy router. 

Virtual IP - ip address that is not bound to a specefic device but serves as a representie to one or more devices. 

Subinterfase - allows a sible physical router or switch to be subdivided into multiple logical inerfaces. 

sub interfaces are cost-efficent and help conduct traffic managemtnt. 

Hot Standy router protocol - developed by CISo as a protocol that can establish a fault-tolerant default gateway. one router is the active router and the other is the standby router, it waits for the active router to fail. 

preempting - where a higher priority router can take over as the primary router. 

virtual router rnduncany protocol - similar to hsrp but is an open standard more compatabiliety. multiple routers can serve as the primary router, simple and sutomatic election scheme. 

Gateway load balancing protocol - cisco developed with load balanging added in. allows multiple routers to provide redundancy, and all routers can simultaniously forward packets. usigng virtual mac addresses. GLBP is great at load balancing.
