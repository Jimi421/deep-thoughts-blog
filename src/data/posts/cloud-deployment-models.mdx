# Cloud Deployment Models

public - systems and users interact with devices, such as the internet. google microcoft, amazaon. public cluds provide a quick and cost effective way. 

private - systems and users only have access with other devices inside the same cloud. A private cloud i

hybrid - combines both private and public cloud options. 

cummunicty - collaborative effort where infrastructure is shared between several different orginizations. 

Multi- Tenancy - allows customers to share computing resources in a public or private cloud. Assigns a particulare resource to a single orginization. Single - genancy solutions. 

# Cloud Deployment Models

### Public Cloud

- Resources delivered over the **public Internet**.
- Owned and operated by third-party providers (AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud).
- **Pros:** Cost-effective, scalable, quick to deploy.
- **Cons:** Less control, shared infrastructure.

---

### Private Cloud

- Cloud infrastructure dedicated to **one organization**.
- Can be on-premises or hosted by a third party.
- **Pros:** More control, security, compliance.
- **Cons:** Higher cost, less scalability than public cloud.

---

### Hybrid Cloud

- **Mix of public + private.**
- Example: company uses private cloud for sensitive data and public cloud for web apps.
- **Pros:** Flexibility, balance of cost and security.
- **Cons:** More complex management.

---

### Community Cloud

- Infrastructure shared by **multiple organizations** with similar needs (e.g., universities, healthcare providers, government agencies).
- **Pros:** Cost sharing, collaboration.
- **Cons:** Limited flexibility, still shared.

---

### Multi-Tenancy vs Single-Tenancy

- **Multi-Tenancy:**
    - Many customers share the same computing resources (VMs, storage).
    - Each customer logically isolated.
    - Example: AWS public cloud.
- **Single-Tenancy:**
    - One customer gets dedicated hardware/resources.
    - Example: Private cloud, or dedicated instances in public cloud.

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- Public = cheapest, fastest.
- Private = most secure, most expensive.
- Hybrid = best of both.
- Community = multiple orgs share for common goals.
- Multi-Tenancy = shared resources (most clouds).
- Single-Tenancy = dedicated resources.

⚡Memory Trick:

Think **PHCM** (Public, Hybrid, Community, Multi-tenancy) → "Please Help Cloud Models."
