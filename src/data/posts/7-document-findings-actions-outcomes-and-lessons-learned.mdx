# Step 7 — Document Findings, Actions, Outcomes, and Lessons Learned

The troubleshooting process ends with rigorous documentation. Recording the facts creates a reference for future incidents, satisfies audit requirements, and reinforces continuous improvement.

## Capture the Essentials

- **Incident summary:** Describe the symptoms, scope, and impacted services.
- **Timeline:** Note when the problem was reported, when major milestones occurred, and when the issue was resolved.
- **Diagnostic steps:** List the tests performed, data collected, and theories evaluated—even those that did not pan out.

## Record the Resolution

- **Actions taken:** Detail the fixes implemented, including configuration changes, hardware replacements, or temporary workarounds.
- **Validation results:** Document the tests that confirmed restoration and the stakeholders who signed off.
- **Preventive measures:** Summarize any patches, policy changes, or monitoring enhancements added in Step 6.

## Share and Store the Knowledge

- **Knowledge base updates:** Publish an article, runbook entry, or FAQ that others can follow.
- **Team debrief:** Highlight what worked well, what slowed the response, and opportunities to streamline next time.
- **Ticket closure:** Ensure service desk systems, change records, and asset databases reflect the final state.

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- Step 7 closes the loop—**if it isn’t documented, it didn’t happen.**
- Thorough documentation accelerates future troubleshooting and supports compliance.
- Lessons learned should feed back into training, monitoring, and process improvements.

⚡ **Memory Hook:** *Document → Timeline, Actions, Validation, Lessons.*
