# IPV4

four decimil numers separated by dots 10.1.2.3 dotted decimal notation. Each section is an octet. 8 bts of a binary numbe. Each is represented by a value of 0 to 265. gives total 32 bits. it 

Network portion - 

Host portion 

subnet mask- continous stirngs of ones and zeros making up the host and network portion. 

5 classes. 

A 1 st octet value Devault mask 255.0.0.0 16.7 million hosts

B 128- 191. default mask 255.255.0.0 65536 hosts. 

C 192-223 default mask 255.255.255.0 256 hosts. 

D 224-239 multicast routing address. Logical address for a group of computers that can be multipcase. 

E 240 255 experemtal, for R and D

Classless Mask. Used to borrow some of the host bits from an IPV4 to be used as a network portion. 

ex 192.168.0.1. 255.255.255.0 if i only need 64 hosts use 255.255.255.192

Classless interdomain routing . CIDR 

192.168.1.4/24

# IPV4 Addressing (N10-009)

### Dotted-Decimal Notation

- **Format:** four decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., **10.1.2.3**).
- Each section = **octet** = **8 bits** → value **0–255** (not 265).
- Total address length = **32 bits**.

### Network vs Host Portion

- Split by the **subnet mask** (contiguous 1s for network, 0s for host).
- Example: **/24** (255.255.255.0) → first 24 bits = network, last 8 bits = host.

# Classful Addressing (legacy but tested)

| Class | 1st Octet Range | Default Mask | Usable Hosts per Network* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | **1–126** | **255.0.0.0 (/8)** | 16,777,214 |
| B | **128–191** | **255.255.0.0 (/16)** | 65,534 |
| C | **192–223** | **255.255.255.0 (/24)** | 254 |
| D | **224–239** | Multicast | n/a |
| E | **240–255** | Experimental | n/a |
- Usable hosts = 2^(host bits) − 2 (network + broadcast).

Note: **127.x.x.x** reserved for loopback.

### Private (RFC 1918) Ranges (Must Know)

- Class A: **10.0.0.0/8**
- Class B: **172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (/12)**
- Class C: **192.168.0.0/16**

# Classless Addressing (CIDR)

- **CIDR** = Classless Inter-Domain Routing → writes masks as **/prefix** (e.g., **192.168.1.4/24**).
- Lets you **borrow host bits** to create more subnets (VLSM).

### Example (your scenario)

- Start: **192.168.0.0/24** (mask 255.255.255.0) → host bits = 8 → 254 usable hosts.
- Need ≈ **64 hosts** → choose **/26** (**255.255.255.192**)
    - Host bits = 6 → **2^6 = 64**, **usable = 64−2 = 62** (fits “~64 hosts”).
- /26 subnets of 192.168.0.0:
    - 192.168.0.0/26 (hosts .1–.62, bcast .63)
    - 192.168.0.64/26 (hosts .65–.126, bcast .127)
    - 192.168.0.128/26 (hosts .129–.190, bcast .191)
    - 192.168.0.192/26 (hosts .193–.254, bcast .255)

**Exam Tip:** When they say “needs 60–64 hosts,” pick **/26**.

# Quick Subnet Cheat Table (High-Yield)

| Prefix | Mask | Usable Hosts | Block Size in 4th Octet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /24 | 255.255.255.0 | 254 | 1 |
| /25 | 255.255.255.128 | 126 | 128 |
| /26 | 255.255.255.192 | 62 | 64 |
| /27 | 255.255.255.224 | 30 | 32 |
| /28 | 255.255.255.240 | 14 | 16 |
| /29 | 255.255.255.248 | 6 | 8 |
| /30 | 255.255.255.252 | 2 | 4 |

**Memory Trick:** “128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4” are the block sizes for /25 → /30.

# Must-Know Definitions

- **Subnet mask:** Delimits network/host bits (contiguous 1s then 0s).
- **Network address:** First address in subnet (all host bits 0).
- **Broadcast address:** Last address (all host bits 1).
- **Gateway (router) IP:** Typically first usable (.1) but can be any usable.

# Flashcards

- **Q:** Range of a single octet? **A:** 0–255.
- **Q:** How many usable hosts in /26? **A:** 62.

# Rapid Review Questions

1. You need at least 30 hosts per subnet. Smallest prefix? → **/27** (30 usable).
2. First subnet of 10.0.0.0/26: network? broadcast? → **10.0.0.0**, **10.0.0.63**.
3. Which class has default mask /16? → **Class B**.
