# Documentation and Process

# Administrative (Management) Controls — What to Know for Network+

### Big Picture

- **Administrative controls** = management decisions that direct technical + physical security.
- Think **top-down**: **Governance → Policies → Standards/Baselines → Procedures & Guidelines**.

---

## Governance

- **IT Governance**: overall **framework** that aligns security with business goals (roles, accountability, risk appetite, compliance).
- Examples: adopting **NIST CSF**, **ISO 27001**, setting risk tolerance, audit cadence.

---

## Policies (High-Level “What & Why”)

- Define intent, scope, and responsibilities. Mandatory.
- **Types you’ll see on exams:**
    - **Organizational (Program/EISP):** company-wide direction (who owns security, objectives).
    - **System-Specific (SSSP):** requirements for a particular tech/system (e.g., “VPN policy for Remote Access Server”).
    - **Issue-Specific (ISSP):** focused topic (e.g., **Acceptable Use**, **Password Policy**, **Email/AI/Cloud policy**).

**Exam Tip:** Policy = **management intent**; no step-by-step detail.

---

## Standards (Mandatory “How Much/How Exactly”)

- Implement the policy with **uniform, measurable requirements**.
- Examples: “Passwords ≥ 14 chars, MFA required; TLS 1.3 only; AES-256 at rest; log retention 365 days.”

---

## Baselines (Mandatory **Minimums**)

- The **minimum acceptable security** configuration across similar assets.
- Examples: “Windows Server baseline: disable SMBv1, enable host firewall, audit categories X/Y/Z, CIS level-1 controls enabled.”

**Must Know:** **Baseline = minimum**; **Standard = exact specification**.

---

## Procedures (Mandatory “How-To Steps”)

- **Detailed, step-by-step** instructions anyone can follow.
- Examples: “Join host to domain → apply baseline GPO → enroll EDR → verify logs in SIEM.”

---

## Guidelines (Recommended “Best Practice”)

- **Advisory**, allow exceptions with approval.
- Example: “Video editors may exceed default 1 TB storage; request up to 5 TB with manager sign-off.”

---

## Why “Administrative” Controls Matter

- Drive **technical** (firewalls, EDR, ACLs) and **physical** (badges, cameras, mantraps) controls.
- Enable **auditability, consistency, and compliance**.
- **Most important part**: people follow clear rules that are enforced and reviewed.

---

## Quick Examples (tie it together)

- **Policy:** “All remote access must be secure.”
- **Standard:** “Only TLS 1.3; MFA via TOTP; VPN must be WireGuard or IKEv2.”
- **Baseline:** “Remote laptops: full-disk encryption, EDR, CIS-L1, auto-patch ≤ 7 days.”
- **Procedure:** “Create VPN account → enroll MFA → install client → validate connection logs.”
- **Guideline:** “Preferred MFA app: Authenticator X; Y allowed if traveling without smartphone.”
