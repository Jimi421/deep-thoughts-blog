# Virtual Local Access Networks (vLAN)

Logical subdivision of a given network that segments into separate broacdcast domains. Acheived through a sowfware configuration. 

using VLANs different switchports can be used for different VLANs. 

When a switch is configured to utilized a vlan it will tag each frame of data with a VLAN ID as it passes through the swithc. 

enhanced securety 

improved performcnae - reduces the sie of a broadcast domain to 

increased management - providing greatoer control over the managemtn of the networks to implement the policy changes and troubleshoot 

improved cost efficency - breaking the exisgin network into smaller logica lsegments, less hardware is needed. 

Effective VLANs must maintain a VLAN databse that contains all the VLAN info fro the switch 

VLAN ID 

vlan NAME 

VLAN.DAT

SWITCH VIRTUAL INTERFACE - svi allows switchigng to route traffic between VLANs without needing a separate router. can handle the routing descisions for a vlan

# Virtual LANs (VLANs) (N10-009)

### **Definition**

- **Logical subdivision** of a physical network.
- Segments a switch into **separate broadcast domains** using **software configuration**.
- Achieved via **VLAN tagging** (IEEE 802.1Q standard).

---

### **How VLANs Work**

- Switchports can be assigned to **different VLANs**.
- Each VLAN = separate broadcast domain.
- Switch adds a **VLAN ID (tag)** to Ethernet frames so traffic stays in the correct VLAN.
- **VLAN database (VLAN.dat):**
    - VLAN ID
    - VLAN Name
    - Stored on switch for persistence.

---

### **Benefits of VLANs**

1. **Security:** Users/devices segmented, traffic isolated.
2. **Performance:** Reduces size of each broadcast domain.
3. **Management:** Easier policy enforcement, troubleshooting.
4. **Cost Efficiency:** One switch can serve multiple VLANs → less hardware required.

---

### **Switch Virtual Interface (SVI)**

- Logical interface on a switch that allows it to **route traffic between VLANs**.
- Provides **Layer 3 functionality** (routing) without needing a separate router.
- Used in **Inter-VLAN routing**.
- Example: VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 on same switch can communicate through the SVI.

✅ **Must-Know Exam Points**

- **VLAN = logical broadcast domain.**
- **802.1Q = VLAN tagging standard.**
- **SVI = enables inter-VLAN routing on a Layer 3 switch.**
- VLANs provide **segmentation, security, performance, and management.**
