# SNMP (Simple Network management protocol)

An internet protocol for collecitn, organizing, and modifiying informaton about managed devices on IP networks. 

Managed deviced - any device that can communicate with an SNMP manager 

SNMP  Manager - any machine on network running snmp protocol to colleoct and process 

SNMP agents - devices that are sending info about themselves back to the snmp manager. 

set - manager to agent .. change value of a variable. 

get manger to agent .. retreve the value of a variable from the agent to the manger. 

trap - agent to manager. agent notify manager of real time events. 

ex uptime, config changes, unexpected downtime of a link.. 

granulatr trap - each SNMP trap has an OID

 OID, Identifies a vriable that can be read or setMIB used to describe thesstructure of the managemtn data of a device subsystem using hierarchel namespace. 

MIb - used to desribed the management strudc data of a hierachale namespace. 

SNMP traps don’t send redundant info. 

verbose trap - configured to contain all info about a given alert. 

Variable binding - data stored in a key value configuration. 

snmpv1 use community string to give access to their security mechanasim. default community strings are publice or private and are a security risk. 

v2 

v3 - newest most secure. 

intregrithy - hash messages 

authengication - source validation 

confidentiality - encryption DES 56 bit key or AES if you have a firmware upgrade. groups comonets into different componets. 

# 📡 SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)

**Definition:**

Internet protocol for **collecting, organizing, and modifying information** about managed devices on IP networks.

## 🔑 Components

- **Managed Devices**
    - Any device running an SNMP agent (routers, switches, servers, printers).
- **SNMP Manager**
    - Central system running SNMP software.
    - Collects/processes info from agents.
- **SNMP Agents**
    - Run on devices.
    - Send info back to SNMP manager.

---

## 📊 Core Operations

- **GET** → Manager asks agent for variable value.
- **SET** → Manager changes a variable on agent.
- **TRAP** → Agent notifies manager of an event (e.g., link down).
- **Variable Binding** → Key-value pairs that define SNMP data.

---

## 🗂️ MIB & OIDs

- **MIB (Management Information Base):**
    - Defines the structure of managed data in a hierarchical namespace.
- **OID (Object Identifier):**
    - Unique identifier for each variable that can be read/set.

---

## 🛎️ Traps

- **Granular Trap** → Only includes specific OID(s).
- **Verbose Trap** → Includes full context/details for the event.
- Traps don’t send redundant info → only triggered events.

---

## 🔐 SNMP Versions

- **SNMPv1**
    - Uses **community strings** (“public” / “private”).
    - ⚠️ Weak security (plaintext).
- **SNMPv2c**
    - Adds bulk transfers, still uses community strings.
    - Slightly improved performance, still insecure.
- **SNMPv3** (most secure, recommended)
    - Adds:
        - **integrity** → hash messages to prevent tampering.
        - **Authentication** → validate source.
        - **Confidentiality** → encryption (DES 56-bit, or AES if supported).

## ✅ Exam Tips

- **Trap = agent → manager notification.**
- **GET/SET = manager ↔ agent requests.**
- **MIB = database structure; OID = unique variable identifier.**
- **SNMPv1/v2 = insecure (plaintext community strings).**
- **SNMPv3 = secure (encryption, authentication, integrity).**
- **Default community strings = BIG risk → must be changed.**
