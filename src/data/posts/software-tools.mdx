# Software Tools

wi-fi analyzer -used to conuct wireless surveys, and to prevent non -desired overlap between wireles access points channels and zones. 

protocol analyzer and packet capture -  used to capture and analyze packets over a network

packet captureing tool - used to capture packets , wireshark. breakdown of each packet. cybersecurity also use it to trace, and view the contents of packets. 

ethereal, protocol, expert, 

packet capture packet snipper - tcpdup, windup. ect.. 

bandwidth speed test - verifies the real world throughput from a client device to the way back out to the inernet and back. downloads large random file from the internet and uploads it again to check throughput. there is a LAN version also. 

port scanner - scanns a poert to see if it open closed, or accepting connectiong. nmap 

NetFlow analyzer - perfomr monitoring troubleshooting and in-depth inspection, interpetation and synthis of traffic flow data. you can see what applicton ther is and 

IP scanner - scanns for an IP address , normally can scann for a port scanner. 

know which tool is for what. 

# Software Tools (Network+ N10-009)

### Wireless Tools

- **Wi-Fi Analyzer**
    - Performs wireless site surveys.
    - Identifies overlapping channels, rogue APs, weak coverage.
    - Helps optimize AP placement & channel usage.

---

### Traffic Capture & Analysis

- **Protocol Analyzer / Packet Sniffer**
    - Captures & inspects packets on the network.
    - Tools: **Wireshark** (formerly Ethereal), **tcpdump** (Linux), **WinDump** (Windows).
    - Used for troubleshooting, performance analysis, and security investigations.
- **Packet Capture Example Uses:**
    - Check handshake process.
    - Identify retransmissions.
    - Inspect payload for malicious traffic.

---

### Performance Testing

- **Bandwidth/Speed Test Tools**
    - Measure **real-world throughput** (download/upload).
    - Can test Internet path (e.g., Speedtest.net) or LAN-only.
    - Detects congestion, ISP throttling, or poor LAN performance.

---

### Scanning & Discovery

- **Port Scanner**
    - Identifies open, closed, or filtered ports.
    - Tool: **Nmap** (industry standard).
    - Helps locate services, test firewall rules.
- **IP Scanner / Network Scanner**
    - Discovers hosts and devices on a subnet.
    - Can overlap with port scanning.
    - Useful for inventory and detecting rogue devices.

---

### Flow Analysis

- **NetFlow Analyzer**
    - Uses Cisco’s NetFlow (or IPFIX) to collect traffic flow data.
    - Provides **who, what, where** of network traffic.
    - Helps identify heavy users, suspicious flows, or app-layer usage.

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- **Wi-Fi Analyzer** = wireless coverage & channels.
- **Protocol Analyzer** = packet-level inspection (e.g., Wireshark).
- **Port Scanner (Nmap)** = check open/closed ports.
- **NetFlow Analyzer** = analyze traffic flow patterns.
- **Speed Test** = measure throughput (LAN or Internet).
- **IP Scanner** = find active hosts.
