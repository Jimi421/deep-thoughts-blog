# Fiber Optic Media

Fiber medeia - used to transmit data using light on glass or instead of electircal impulses. 

EMI immunity 

xtended data transmission range 

fiber cables significanltly faster speeds compared to cpper cables. 

Fiber cable is not the limiting factor in networking equpment. Routers, switches, and user devices. Fiber typically opperate from 10 to 100 gigabits per second. 

Drawbacks: cost much more vs copper

fiber optic calbes are more challenging to work with. 

copper cabele kit 

10 to 15 usd 

fiber kit 250 usd

single mode fiber: designed for long-distance communication and features a small gladss core 8.3 microns. less than human hair. light can only travel down a single path, that’s why it’s single mode. 

multi mode is for “shorter runs” under 2k or 1 mile routers to swithces wtc

Singe mode - yellow sheath (SMF) 

aqua blue or orange heath multi mode fiber (MMF) 

# Fiber Media (CompTIA Network+)

### Basics

- **Transmits data using light** instead of electricity.
- Immune to **EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)**.
- Supports **longer distances** than copper.
- Very **high speeds** (10–100+ Gbps).
- Limiting factor = networking gear (switches, routers), **not the cable**.

### Drawbacks

- **Expensive** (fiber kits ≈ $250 vs copper ≈ $10–15).
- **Harder to install/repair** (requires special tools & training).

### Types of Fiber

- **Single-Mode Fiber (SMF)**
    - Core: **8–10 microns** (very small, thinner than a hair).
    - Light travels in **one path** → less dispersion.
    - **Long-distance**: up to **tens/hundreds of km**.
    - Commonly used for **backbone and WAN links**.
    - Jacket: **Yellow**.
- **Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF)**
    - Core: **50–100 microns**.
    - Light travels in **multiple paths** → more dispersion, shorter range.
    - “Short runs” → up to **2 km (1 mile)**.
    - Used inside buildings, between routers/switches/servers.
    - Jacket: **Aqua blue or Orange**.

✅ **Exam Tips**

- If you see **backbone/long distance** → **SMF (yellow)**.
- If you see **LAN/datacenter short run** → **MMF (aqua/orange)**.
- Fiber = **immune to EMI**, copper = **vulnerable**.

⚡Rapid Review Q’s

1. Which fiber type uses a **small 8–10 micron core**?
2. Which fiber type is best for **short runs (&lt; 2 km)**?
3. Which sheath color = single-mode fiber?

Want me to also add the **common fiber connectors (SC, LC, ST, MPO)** so you’ve got both **media + connectors** bundled for quick recall
