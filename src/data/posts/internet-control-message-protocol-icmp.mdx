# Internet Control Message Protocol ICMP

Intergral part of the Internet Protocol Suite which is a set of nteworking protocls used on the network.  

Its a network layer protocol that’s for diagnosing problems, and trouble shottign. It’s a layer 3 protocol. 

When a service or host in unreachable 

whena. packet’s time is too long

type , code, checksum 

Icmp lacks the reliablilty of the TCP protocol. 

ICMP prioritizes speed and simplitiry over data intregrity and security. 

ICMP flood attack and ping atack are threat actions using icmp 

icmp FLOOd sends overwhelming amount of icmp packets

DDoS wher an attacker uses a botnet to send the ping flood. 

Ping of Death 

Attack that exploits older unpatched systems. sents a packet lardger thatn 65,535 

Network admins may choose to block icmp traffic. 

# 📡 ICMP – Internet Control Message Protocol

**Layer:** 3 (Network Layer)

**Purpose:** Used for **diagnosing network issues**, not for transferring data.

## ✅ Key Functions of ICMP

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Error Reporting** | Notifies sender if packet delivery fails |
| **Diagnostics** | Used by tools like `ping` and `traceroute` |
| **Speed & Simplicity** | Prioritizes speed over reliability or security |
| **Not reliable** | No acknowledgments, no session tracking (unlike TCP) |

---

## 🔍 Common ICMP Use Cases

- **Ping** – Checks if a host is reachable
- **Traceroute** – Maps the path to a host
- **Destination Unreachable** – Notifies when a route fails
- **Time Exceeded** – TTL expired (used in `traceroute`)

## 🧱 ICMP Message Structure

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Type** | Indicates the message purpose (e.g., echo request = 8, echo reply = 0) |
| **Code** | Gives context for the type |
| **Checksum** | Basic error detection |

## ☠️ ICMP Attack Types

| Attack Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **ICMP Flood** | Sends large numbers of ping requests to overwhelm a target (aka **Ping Flood**) |
| **DDoS via ICMP** | Uses **botnets** to launch large-scale ICMP floods |
| **Ping of Death** | Sends ICMP packets **larger than 65,535 bytes**, crashing older systems |

> 💡 Modern OSs are patched against Ping of Death, but it's still testable knowledge.

## 🚫 ICMP Blocking

- **Network admins often block ICMP** at firewalls to prevent abuse
- Can hinder diagnostic tools like **ping** or **traceroute**

## ⚡ Rapid Review Questions

1. **What OSI layer does ICMP operate at?**
    
    → Layer 3 (Network)
    
2. **What is ICMP used for?**
    
    → Diagnostics and error reporting (not data transfer)
    
3. **What’s a common attack that abuses ICMP?**
    
    → ICMP Flood / Ping Flood
    
4. **Why might ICMP be blocked on a network?**
    
    → To prevent DDoS attacks and scanning abuse
