# User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

A communication protocol used across the internet especially for time-sensitive transmissions. 

It’s best for situations where speed is critical and error handeling can be done by the application or is not that nessecary. 

known for 

low latency 

reducd processing overhead

it’s at layer 4. 

tcp 3 way handshake ≠ UDP 

Source dest port numbers, legenth field, check sums 

packets are 8 bytes vs 20-60 for TCP. no error checking or recovery, but it is faster. 

UDP’s Stateless natuere

does not maintain the stae of the connection or keep track of the packers, fire and forget. 

udp does not ned an acknowledgement from the recier, to may not arive or be out of synquence. 

Udp IS use where the SPEED is the most important thing. online gaming VOIP, sttreaming. 

UDP relies on ports to help diffenerate between multiple services or appicatons 

UCP includes a chucksum to provide som minimal protection against data corruption during transsion. 

# ⚡ UDP – User Datagram Protocol (Layer 4)

**Lightweight, connectionless protocol** used when **speed and low latency** are more important than reliability.

## ✅ Core Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Connectionless** | No handshake or connection tracking |
| **Unreliable Delivery** | No acknowledgments, no retransmissions |
| **Low Overhead** | Only **8 bytes** per header (vs TCP’s 20–60 bytes) |
| **Stateless** | Doesn’t maintain session state — “**fire and forget**” |
| **Faster** | Ideal for **real-time applications** |
| **Minimal error checking** | Includes a **checksum**, but no recovery or sequencing |

## 🔧 UDP Header Fields (8 bytes total)

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Source Port** | Identifies sender’s port |
| **Destination Port** | Identifies receiving app/service |
| **Length** | Total length of UDP header + data |
| **Checksum** | Optional error detection (basic integrity check) |

## 🧠 Key Differences: TCP vs UDP

| Feature | TCP | UDP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Handshake | 3-way handshake | No handshake |
| Reliability | Reliable (ACKs, retries) | Unreliable (no ACKs) |
| Header Size | 20–60 bytes | 8 bytes |
| Speed | Slower (more overhead) | Faster (low overhead) |
| Use Cases | Web, Email, File Transfer | **Streaming, VoIP, Gaming** |
| Stateful | Maintains connection state | **Stateless** |

## 🚀 When to Use UDP

Use UDP when:

- **Speed > Accuracy**
- Some data loss is **acceptable**
- App handles its own error correction (if needed)

### 🔊 Common UDP Use Cases:

- **VoIP (Voice over IP)**
- **Streaming video/audio**
- **Online multiplayer gaming**
- **DNS queries**

## ⚡ Rapid Review Questions

1. **What layer does UDP operate on?**
    
    → Layer 4 (Transport)
    
2. **What makes UDP faster than TCP?**
    
    → No handshake, smaller header, no tracking or retransmissions
    
3. **Does UDP guarantee delivery?**
    
    → No
    
4. **What’s a key reason UDP is used in streaming?**
    
    → **Low latency** – dropped packets don’t halt the stream
