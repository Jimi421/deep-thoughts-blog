# QoS Quality of service

Neworks are converged - high level of availability to help with all th emedia video voice text data. 

QoS - Being stratagic on how we use the data resources based on catagorization. how much band wih is required and efficently use WAN lijnks. id types of traffic to drop durijng conjection voice and video should be the priority. 

Delay - The time a packet travels from source to destination .. not that big in data, but huge in lviestream 

jitter. - uneven arrival packets which is especiallyharmful in VoIP traffice. 

Drop - occurs when network conjection and a router queue overflows its memory causing packet loss. 

Effective bandwidth - only as fast as the weakest link. 

Purpose - to separate traffic and prioritize some to increase user experience. 

You want high quality of service for Voip and lower quality for email so that

Document and share with the users. Post to the internal website. Make sure users know. 

Best effort - donâ€™t have any qos ata ll traffic is first in, first out. No qos. 

Intergrateed services - Hard QoS - Traffic has strict bandwidth reservations 

Diferentated services - Sofg qux routers and switchescan make descisions based on traffic. 

classicification - traffic is placed into differnent categories .. email (pop3, imap, smtp, exchange see which is most important) do the same across all catagories. usind deep packet aynalasis. 

marking - alters the bits within a frame,cell or packet network tools will make descysion based on the markings.  

conjestion management - determines the order in which packets are sent out an interface based on policy
