# Remote access technology

Telnet - port 23 sends text-based commands and is unencrypted not secure. 

secure shell - port 22 - encrypts everything that is being sent and recived between the client and the server. 

RDP - port 3389 - provides graphicle interface to connect to another computer over a network. 

RGD can create a secure gateway and then tunnel into a 

RDG - provides. secure connection using SSL/TLS to secure RTP. 

VNC - port 5900 designed for thin client archiceture or VDI. 

Virtual desktop infristructure. hosts a desktop enfrin on a centalized server. Desktop as a service. 

In band - using telnet or SSH. 

out of band - connecting to th emanagement network to manage the devices on the network. 

API - Application prgramming interface. set of protocols and routines for building and interacing with software applications. allow for direct intergration of different tird party 

# üåç Remote Access Technologies

## üîë Core Protocols

- **Telnet (TCP/23)**
    - Text-based remote command access.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Unencrypted** ‚Üí insecure, replaced by SSH.
- **SSH ‚Äì Secure Shell (TCP/22)**
    - Encrypted alternative to Telnet.
    - Used for secure CLI management (routers, switches, Linux servers).
- **RDP ‚Äì Remote Desktop Protocol (TCP/3389)**
    - Microsoft protocol for **graphical remote access**.
    - Used to connect to Windows desktops/servers.
- **RDG ‚Äì Remote Desktop Gateway**
    - Wraps RDP inside **SSL/TLS** for secure tunneling.
    - Allows RDP connections over the internet safely.
- **VNC ‚Äì Virtual Network Computing (TCP/5900)**
    - Provides graphical desktop sharing.
    - Often used in thin client or **VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure)** setups.

## üñ•Ô∏è Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)

- Runs desktops on centralized servers ‚Üí accessed remotely.
- Can be delivered as **DaaS (Desktop as a Service)** from the cloud.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Management Access

- **In-Band Management**
    - Uses the same network as production traffic.
    - Examples: SSH, RDP, Telnet.
- **Out-of-Band Management**
    - Uses a **separate management network** or console connection.
    - Used when the production network is down.

---

## üîó API (Application Programming Interface)

- Set of rules/protocols for interacting with software.
- Allows direct **integration of third-party apps/services**.
- Common in **cloud, automation, and remote management**.

---

## ‚úÖ Exam Tips

- **Telnet = insecure, SSH = secure**.
- **RDP = graphical remote access**, enhanced by **RDG**.
- **VNC = platform-independent GUI remote access**.
- **In-band = production network**, **Out-of-band = dedicated mgmt path**.
- **API = enables automation and remote integration**.
