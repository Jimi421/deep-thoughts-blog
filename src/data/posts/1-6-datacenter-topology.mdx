# 1.6 Datacenter Topology

A **data center** is a facility that organizations use to house computing, storage, and networking resources. These environments are designed for high availability, security, and scalability so that critical applications and data remain accessible. Modern examples, such as the Utah Data Center, illustrate the massive scale and power demands involved in operating national-level infrastructure.

## Three-Tier Hierarchy

Many enterprise networks still follow the classic three-tier model:

- **Core layer** – The high-speed backbone that aggregates traffic from multiple distribution blocks. Core devices are optimized for throughput and redundancy.
- **Distribution (Aggregation) layer** – Enforces policies such as quality of service, filtering, and routing decisions. It provides a demarcation point between the core and access layers.
- **Access (Edge) layer** – Connects end devices like servers, workstations, and IoT endpoints. This layer focuses on port density and access control.

## Collapsed Core Designs

Smaller data centers often merge the core and distribution roles into a **collapsed core**. Combining these layers reduces the number of switches, simplifies management, and can lower latency, while still providing the policy controls required at the edge.

## Spine-and-Leaf Fabrics

Modern east-west traffic patterns have led many operators to adopt a **spine-and-leaf** architecture:

- **Leaf switches** provide access-layer connectivity for servers and storage systems.
- **Spine switches** interconnect every leaf switch, creating a non-blocking fabric with predictable latency.

Spine-and-leaf designs can coexist with traditional three-tier hierarchies, letting organizations support both north-south and east-west flows efficiently.

## Traffic Patterns

- **North-south traffic** enters or leaves the data center, typically flowing between users and hosted services. "Northbound" describes traffic leaving the facility, while "southbound" indicates inbound flows.
- **East-west traffic** remains within the data center, such as replication between servers or communication among microservices. Optimizing east-west performance is a key driver behind spine-and-leaf adoption.

Understanding these models helps network professionals select the right topology for scale, performance, and operational requirements.
