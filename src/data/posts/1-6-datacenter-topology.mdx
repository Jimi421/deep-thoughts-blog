# 1.6 Datacenter Topology

Datacenter- Any Facility that buisnesses and other orginizations ue to organize, process, stroea, and disseminate large amounts of dats. 

Utah Data Center 

Intelligence community comprehensive national cybersurity initiave data center.  1.5 million square feet in size. 65 mega watts.  1.5 billion. 

three tiered herearchy - peformance management scalability

Core -  most espensive equipement / backbone

distribution / Aggreation - Defines the policyes for the network

Access/ Eddge - connets all the end point devices.  

collapsed core - Network architecture where the core and distribution are merged into a single layer. functions of discrubion and core are combined. reduces the numbrer of switche and latency. 

Spine and leaf 

An alternative type that focuseson the communication within the datacenter. 

Spine - connects switches in a full mesh topoligy. 

leaf - consists of all the acdcess switches. faster speeds and lower latency. 

spine and leaf can be used in combination witht he thiree tiered herearchy. 

Traffic flows 

north - south Traffic that enters or leaves from outside the traffice. northbount is  leaing the datacenter. southbound it is tnereiing the datcener. 

East west traffice within data center is ease and west once itâ€™s in its east west traffic.
