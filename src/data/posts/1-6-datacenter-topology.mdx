# 1.6 Datacenter Topology

A datacenter is a facility where organizations consolidate servers, storage, and networking gear to process, store, and disseminate large volumes of data. Modern designs balance resiliency, performance, and scalability while keeping operations efficient.

## Case Study: Utah Data Center

The U.S. intelligence community’s Utah Data Center spans roughly 1.5 million square feet, draws approximately 65 megawatts of power, and cost an estimated $1.5 billion. Facilities at this scale highlight the importance of efficient layouts and robust power and cooling strategies.

## Classic Three-Tier Hierarchy

Three-tier architectures separate roles so that each layer can scale independently.

- **Core:** The high-speed backbone that interconnects distribution blocks and provides redundant, low-latency paths to external networks. Equipment here is the most capable—and expensive.
- **Distribution (Aggregation):** Enforces policies such as routing boundaries, quality of service (QoS), and security controls. It also aggregates access layer switches.
- **Access (Edge):** Connects end devices such as servers, hypervisors, and appliances. It manages VLAN assignments, PoE delivery, and port security.

## Collapsed Core

In smaller facilities, the core and distribution layers can be combined into a single tier, reducing hardware costs and latency. This *collapsed core* still enforces policy and provides high-speed switching, but with fewer devices to manage.

## Spine-and-Leaf Fabric

Newer datacenters often adopt a **spine-and-leaf** architecture to deliver predictable east-west performance.

- **Leaf switches** connect servers and storage devices. Each leaf connects to every spine switch, ensuring consistent latency no matter which rack a workload lives in.
- **Spine switches** form the fast backbone that links the leaves. Traffic between any two leaves only traverses a single spine hop.

Spine-and-leaf designs can coexist with a traditional three-tier hierarchy—spine/leaf within a pod, connected upstream to a core network.

## Traffic Patterns

- **North–south traffic:** Flows into or out of the datacenter toward users or the internet. Northbound means exiting the datacenter; southbound means entering it.
- **East–west traffic:** Moves laterally between systems inside the datacenter, such as server-to-server or server-to-storage communication.

Understanding how traffic flows informs where to place firewalls, load balancers, and monitoring taps to protect and optimize the environment.

✅ **Exam Highlights**

- Three-tier = **core**, **distribution**, **access**.
- Collapsed core merges **core + distribution** for smaller deployments.
- Spine-and-leaf ensures consistent latency for east-west traffic.
- North–south vs. east–west traffic helps you position security and monitoring controls.
