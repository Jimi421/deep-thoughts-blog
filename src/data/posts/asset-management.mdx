# Asset Management

Effective asset management provides visibility into the hardware, software, and intangible resources an organization relies on. A structured program helps teams control costs, maintain compliance, and respond quickly when equipment fails or needs replacement.

## Asset Categories

- **Tangible assets:** Physical items such as servers, laptops, networking gear, and facilities.
- **Intangible assets:** Non-physical resources like intellectual property, software licenses, and brand reputation.

## Lifecycle Stages

1. **Planning and Procurement** – Identify requirements, secure funding, and purchase assets. Assign tracking identifiers as soon as equipment is received.
2. **Deployment** – Configure assets securely, document their locations, and link them to support tickets or change requests when necessary.
3. **Operation and Maintenance** – Monitor performance, apply updates, and record incidents or changes in a centralized inventory system.
4. **Review and Optimization** – Evaluate warranty coverage, renew support contracts, and verify license compliance.
5. **Retirement and Disposal** – Sanitize data, follow environmental guidelines, and update records to reflect the asset’s end of life.

## Governance Practices

- Maintain a **comprehensive asset inventory** with unique IDs or barcode/RFID tags for each item.
- Integrate the inventory with **ticketing and change-management systems** to track ownership, status, and approvals.
- Document **naming conventions** for workstations, network devices, and virtual assets so they can be located and referenced consistently.
- Enforce **change management procedures** that evaluate business impact, budget considerations, deployment plans, and required approvals before modifications occur.

Strong governance ensures that asset information remains accurate, making it easier to plan refresh cycles, satisfy audits, and reduce the risk of shadow IT.
