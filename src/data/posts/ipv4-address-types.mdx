# IPV4 Address types

Pulblic - routable uniqeu ip address assigned to each device on the internet that allows it to communciate with other addresses on the network . dotted decimal notatpoon eg 66.51.41.112 must be leashed or purchaed managed by 

ICANN globally manages and leases publically roubable ip addresses

NA ARIN, LA LACNIC , AFRIC AFNIC APNIC ASIA, RIPE eurpoe. 

Private- private (non-routable) used within a local network thtat allows for the ommunicaton between devices within that network without usina. public ip address.

NAT NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION - method that allows a router to be an agent between a public ip address and a private address so that we don’t need to use so many public ip addresses.

# IPV4 Addressing & Special Ranges

### **Public IP**

- **Routable, globally unique** addresses used on the Internet.
- Must be purchased/leased from **ICANN/IANA** → delegated to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs):
    - **ARIN** (North America)
    - **LACNIC** (Latin America)
    - **AFRINIC** (Africa)
    - **APNIC** (Asia Pacific)
    - **RIPE NCC** (Europe, Middle East, parts of Central Asia)

---

### **Private IP (RFC 1918)**

- **Non-routable**; used inside LANs.
- Requires **NAT** to reach the Internet.

Ranges:

- **Class A:** 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (/8)
- **Class B:** 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (/12) ⚠️ *Exam trick: Only 172.16–31 is private; 172.0–15 and 172.32+ are public!*
- **Class C:** 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (/16)

---

### **Other Important Ranges**

- **Loopback:** 127.0.0.1 (used to test TCP/IP stack).
- **APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing):** 169.254.0.0 – 169.254.255.255
    - Assigned when DHCP fails.
    - Self-assigns an address, only valid on the local segment.

---

### **NAT (Network Address Translation)**

- Allows private IP devices to access public networks by translating private ↔ public addresses.
- **PAT (Port Address Translation):** many private devices share one public IP, differentiated by port numbers.

---

✅ **Exam Tips**

- **RFC 1918 = private IP ranges.**
- **APIPA = 169.254.x.x (DHCP failure fallback).**
- **Loopback = 127.0.0.1.**
- NAT is critical for conserving IPV4 addresses.
