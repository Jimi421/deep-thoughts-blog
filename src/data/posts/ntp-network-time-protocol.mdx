# NTP (NETWORK TIME PROTOCOL)

SYNCS CLOCKS - BETEWEN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS that communicate over a packet switched variable-latency network. TCP. 

NTP uses UDP 123. 

it’s important to make sure we’re all using the same time. it syncs within milisecs. 

Goes through strata

stratum 0 - atomic clock, gps etc. 

stratum 1 is synced to stratum 0. can go down to stratum 14 

improemnts are PTP percision time protocol used to sync clocks sub micro second. more accurate 

NTS - network time security protocol 0 extennon of ntp that provides cryptographic seciurity . 

# Network Time Protocol (NTP)

### Purpose

- **Syncs clocks** between systems on packet-switched, variable-latency networks.
- Ensures consistent timestamps for logs, authentication, security, and transactions.
- Accuracy: within **milliseconds** of UTC.

---

### Protocol Details

- **UDP port 123** (not TCP).
- Operates in **client-server** or **peer-to-peer** mode.

---

### Stratum Levels

- **Stratum 0** → Reference clock (atomic, GPS, radio).
- **Stratum 1** → Directly connected to stratum 0.
- **Stratum 2+** → Gets time from stratum 1, passes it down.
- Can go down to **Stratum 15** (Stratum 16 = unsynchronized).

---

### Improvements

- **PTP (Precision Time Protocol):**
    - More accurate than NTP (sub-microsecond).
    - Used in high-performance networks (finance, telecom, data centers).

---

### Security

- **NTS (Network Time Security):**
    - Extension of NTP.
    - Adds **cryptographic authentication** to prevent spoofing or tampering.

---

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- **NTP port** = UDP 123
- **Why important?** = Consistent time across systems (logging, Kerberos, SSL/TLS, forensic analysis)
- **Stratum 0 = atomic/GPS**, Stratum 1 = synced directly
- **PTP = higher accuracy than NTP**
- **NTS = secure NTP with crypto authentication**

---

⚡Memory Trick:

Think **“123 NTP”** → UDP port **123** is the timekeeper for all.
