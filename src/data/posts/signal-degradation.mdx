# Signal Degradation

Attenuation - loss of signal stergenth on network cable or connection. 

data transmits across the cable and that is the binary data, the copper conduit carries the cable. the copper has a resistance and the data has an issue traveling. as it travels it weakesn 

twisted pair has a 100 meter attunation 

frequency 

noise 

physical surroundings. 

all work at a specefic freqency 

electrical ables are 60 htz 

cat 5e 100 MHZ 

cat 6 250 mhz 

cat 6a 

higher the frequency the higher the bandwidth, the more vibrationn the more bits you can have. 

if you have similare frequencies neare each othr you will have noice. 

noice additional  electrical or radio frequency near the cables 

environment - temp construcion of walls, insullaiton, too cold will slow down, if hot signal will overheat, well insulated wires. 

how to fix. 

make sure youâ€™re using the proper cables. 

2 - shorten the distance, use less than 100 m cables to make sure you ahve good connections 80mm is a good rule 

3 use an amplifier or a repeater, to take in a weaker signal, boost it and resend it. 

For fiber - fiber connetions are normally the cause, just like dirty glasses or a dirty ipad screen .

clean and polish both ends of the connections. 

interference - occurs when multiple cables are in the same proximity. use high quality twisted pair cables or higher sheilding. 

low power near a high poer. 

plan cable runs to opperate in parallel to high power cables. 

decibel - db loss measures the amount of signal degrogation . d

copper - decrease in voltage 

fiber - amount of light lost.
