# VPN(Virtual Private Network)

virtual private network - extends a private network across a public network. you can work in a remote office or work from home with a secure VPN tunnel. 

site to site - two offices. 

client to site - remote user to a corp network. 

clientless - web browser.

full tunnel -routes and encrypts all network requests through the VPN connection back to the headquarters. 

split tunnel -Routes and encrypts only traffic bound for the hedquarters over the vpn the other the internet. 

clientless VPN creates a secure, remote access VPN tunnel using a web browser weithout a full VPN 

ssl secure socket layer - provides cryptograpy and reliaby using upper layers of the OSI model 

ssl and tls use tcp to establish a secure collection. 

DTLS UDP BASED VERSION OF tls AND THA IS faster with no overhead. 

l2tp layer 2 

L2F PROVIDES TUNNELING PROTOCOL FOR the P2P PROTOL BUT ALSO LACKS NATIve security and encryption. 

pptp POINT TO POINT  tunneling - supports dialu p networks but lacks native security features when used with windows. 

ipsec security - provides authentication and 

# üîê Virtual Private Network (VPN)

**Definition:**

A VPN extends a **private network across a public network (Internet)**, creating a secure **encrypted tunnel** for data.

- Enables **remote work** or **secure office-to-office connections**.

---

## üåç VPN Types

- **Site-to-Site VPN**
    - Connects **two offices/networks** over the internet.
    - Example: HQ ‚Üî Branch office.
- **Client-to-Site VPN**
    - Connects a **remote user** to the corporate network.
    - Example: Work-from-home employee.
- **Clientless VPN**
    - Uses a **web browser** (no client software required).
    - Common for quick, limited access to internal apps.

## üö¶ Tunneling Modes

- **Full Tunnel**
    - All traffic (internet + internal) goes through the VPN.
    - ‚úÖ More secure.
    - ‚ùå More bandwidth + latency.
- **Split Tunnel**
    - Only corporate traffic goes through VPN.
    - Internet traffic goes directly out to ISP.
    - ‚úÖ Less overhead.
    - ‚ùå More exposure.

## üìã VPN Protocols

- **SSL/TLS VPN**
    - Operates at **Layer 5‚Äì7** (session/application).
    - Uses **TCP** for encryption & reliability.
    - Secure for browser-based or client VPNs.
- **DTLS (Datagram TLS)**
    - UDP-based version of TLS.
    - Faster, less overhead (good for VoIP, video).
- **L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)**
    - Provides tunneling but **no encryption** alone.
    - Usually combined with IPsec for security.
- **L2F (Layer 2 Forwarding)**
    - Cisco protocol, older, lacks native encryption.
- **PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)**
    - Legacy (Windows dial-up).
    - Weak security, mostly deprecated.
- **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**
    - Operates at **Layer 3 (Network)**.
    - Provides **encryption, authentication, and integrity**.
    - Commonly used with L2TP.
    - Modes:
        - **AH (Authentication Header):** integrity + authentication only.
        - **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload):** integrity + authentication + encryption.

## ‚úÖ Exam Tips

- **Site-to-Site = office ‚Üî office.**
- **Client-to-Site = remote worker.**
- **Clientless = browser-based VPN.**
- **Full tunnel = all traffic through VPN.**
- **Split tunnel = only corporate traffic through VPN.**
- **SSL/TLS = modern, TCP.**
- **DTLS = UDP, faster for real-time apps.**
- **L2TP/PPTP = legacy, weak security unless paired with IPsec.**
- **IPsec = Layer 3, strongest encryption.**
