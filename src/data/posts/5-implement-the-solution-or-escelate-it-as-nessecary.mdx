# 5 - Implement the solution or escelate it as nessecary

# Step 5 — Implement the Solution (or Escalate as Necessary)

### Purpose

- After planning (Step 4), **apply the fix** in a controlled way.
- If you cannot resolve due to **authority, skill, or resources** → **escalate**.

---

### Key Points

- **Follow the plan of action** → implement the repair, replacement, or workaround.
- **Change management** → make sure changes are documented, approved, and scheduled to minimize disruption.
- **Minimize impact** → implement during maintenance windows if possible.
- **Test after implementation** → confirm that the fix is applied correctly.
- **Escalation** →
    - If solution is outside your scope (e.g., requires server team or vendor), escalate with clear documentation of what you’ve done so far.

---

### Example Scenarios

- **Implement:** Replace a bad switch, patch DHCP config, update driver.
- **Workaround:** Redirect traffic to a backup server until root cause can be fixed.
- **Escalate:** Root cause is a domain controller issue — forward to sysadmin team.

---

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- Step 5 = **Do it, or escalate it.**
- Always follow **policies and change management**.
- Ensure minimal disruption to users/systems.
