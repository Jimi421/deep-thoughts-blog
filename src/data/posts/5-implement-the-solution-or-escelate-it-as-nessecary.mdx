# Step 5 — Implement the Solution (or Escalate as Necessary)

With an approved plan in hand, apply the fix methodically. Protect production systems, communicate progress, and be ready to escalate if the solution falls outside your scope.

## Follow the Plan

- **Adhere to change control.** Confirm approvals, maintenance windows, and rollback procedures before touching production systems.
- **Execute deliberately.** Apply each change exactly as documented—whether you are replacing hardware, updating firmware, or deploying a configuration tweak.
- **Minimize disruption.** Coordinate with stakeholders, schedule downtime, and keep users informed about the work in progress.

## Validate During Implementation

- **Test after each step.** Run validation checks or smoke tests as you go to catch unintended consequences early.
- **Monitor health indicators.** Watch logs, performance dashboards, and alerts for signs of instability or regression.
- **Record actions in real time.** Document the commands run, settings changed, and any deviations from the original plan.

## Escalate When Appropriate

- **Authority boundaries:** If the fix requires privileges you do not have or touches systems owned by another team, pause and escalate with a clear summary of your findings.
- **Vendor involvement:** Engage third-party support when warranty, licensing, or proprietary knowledge is required.
- **Communicate status:** Provide stakeholders with progress updates, expected completion times, and any risk that emerges mid-change.

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- Step 5 is about **execution** or **escalation**—do not improvise outside the approved plan.
- Always be prepared to **roll back** if validation fails.
- Escalate when the task exceeds your permissions, skill set, or change window.
