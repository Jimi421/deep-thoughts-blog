# Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)

### Concept

- NFV replaces traditional **hardware-based network appliances** (firewalls, load balancers, routers, IDS/IPS, etc.) with **software-based Virtual Network Functions (VNFs)**.
- Runs on **virtual machines or containers** instead of requiring new physical devices.

---

### Key Components

1. **NFV Infrastructure (NFVI)**
    - All hardware + virtualization resources needed to run VNFs.
    - Includes servers, storage, networking, hypervisors.
2. **Virtual Network Functions (VNFs)**
    - Software versions of networking functions.
    - Examples: virtual firewall, virtual load balancer, virtual router.
3. **Management and Orchestration (MANO)**
    - The “brains” of NFV.
    - Oversees **VNF lifecycle** (deploy, scale, update, retire).
    - Orchestrates resource use across NFVI for efficiency.

---

### Advantages

- **Flexibility** – deploy and update services rapidly.
- **Cost Efficiency** – no need for specialized hardware.
- **Scalability** – add/remove resources quickly.
- **Improved Security** – can patch and update VNFs faster than hardware.

---

### Challenges

- **Complexity** – requires skilled setup and orchestration.
- **Performance Overhead** – software may be slower than dedicated hardware.
- **Installation & Integration** – must integrate VNFs into existing infrastructure.

---

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- NFV uses **VNFs instead of hardware appliances**.
- **NFVI = hardware + virtualization layer.**
- **MANO = lifecycle management + orchestration.**
- Benefits = cost savings, scalability, flexibility.
- Trade-off = complexity, possible performance issues
