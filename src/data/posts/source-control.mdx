# 📂 Version Control & Git

## 🔑 Why Version Control Matters

- Tracks changes to files (usually code/configs).
- Supports **collaboration**, rollback, and auditing.
- Git = most widely used, open-source, actively maintained.

## 📦 Core Git Concepts

- **Repository (repo):** Storage area where versions of code/files are kept.
- **Branching:** Parallel lines of development; merge when changes are stable.
- **.gitignore:** File that specifies what Git should ignore (e.g., secrets, temp files).

## ⚙️ Common Git Commands

- **Initialization & Setup**
    - `git init` → Create or reinitialize a repo.
    - `git config` → Set options (username, email, etc.).
- **Working with Repos**
    - `git clone <url>` → Create a copy of an existing repo.
    - `git status` → Show current state of repo.
    - `git log` → Display commit history.
- **Tracking Changes**
    - `git add <file>` → Stage a file to be tracked.
    - `git commit -m "message"` → Save staged changes to repo.
- **Branching & Merging**
    - `git branch <name>` → Create new branch.
    - `git checkout <name>` → Switch to branch.
    - `git merge <branch>` → Merge branch into current branch.
- **Syncing Changes**
    - `git pull` → Acquire and merge changes from remote.
    - `git push` → Upload local commits to remote repo.

## ✅ Exam/Job Tie-In

- Git often shows up in **DevOps, automation, and config management**.
- Knowing basic commands is useful for **scripting, auditing, and network automation labs**.
- Branching/merging is crucial for team collaboration.
