# intergrations and api

intergration -  proces of combining different subsystems or comonts into one app. 

API - set of rules and protocols that are used for building and intergrating applicaiton software. 

libray of programming utils that allow us to be able to commuincate between different portions of a service. 

rest - representational state transfer - uses HTTP methods, status codes, resource. uses .JSON message and makes it lightweight 

soap - simple object acess protocol. - XML format protocol that defines a strict standart wit a a

rest is more straight forward, soap provides more security. 

APIS allow for intergration between different services. 

freshdesk can get all tickets into one place. anytime you send an email to support it goes to freshdesk it is a tickigngg system. 

# 🔗 Integration & APIs

## 🔑 Integration

- **Definition:** Process of combining different subsystems or components into a single application or workflow.
- Goal: Enable **interoperability** between different software/services.

---

## 🛠️ APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)

- **Definition:** A set of **rules, protocols, and tools** for building and integrating software applications.
- Acts like a **library of utilities** that allows different systems to communicate.
- Example: A helpdesk API (Freshdesk) can pull in all support tickets from email into one system.

---

## 🌐 API Types

- **REST (Representational State Transfer)**
    - Uses **HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
    - **Status codes** (200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error).
    - Data format: **JSON** (lightweight, human-readable).
    - ✅ Easier to use, more flexible.
- **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**
    - Uses **XML** as the message format.
    - Strict standards → more overhead.
    - ✅ Stronger built-in security (WS-Security, encryption, authentication).

## 🔐 REST vs SOAP

- **REST** → Simpler, faster, lightweight, common in modern apps.
- **SOAP** → Heavier, but more secure and standardized.
- **Exam Tip:** CompTIA often phrases this as: *“REST = easier, SOAP = stricter and more secure.”*

---

## ✅ Exam Takeaways

- **APIs enable integration** between apps/services.
- **REST = JSON + HTTP methods**, lightweight.
- **SOAP = XML + strict standards**, more secure.
- Real-world example: **Freshdesk API** integrates email → ticketing system.
