# Subnetting

Subnetting - take a large network to split it up into smaller netowkr.s 

Subnet masks modify netorks and create subnets. 

10.0.0.0/x 16.7

10.0.0.0/8 16.7 million 

10.0.0.0/24 256 IPs

10.0.1.0/24 256 ips 

10.0.2.0/24 256 

A 16.7 MIL, class b 65,5543, class c 254 

/25 , /26, /27 etc can increase the networks, and reduce the host’s per nework. 

2^s = numer of hosts 

you need to use the -2 for the netowrk and the broadcast the first and last in the rnge. 

2h -2  h= number of hosts. 

CIDR notation. 

classless interdomain routing. 192.168.1.0/26 

Variable - Legnth subnet mask (VLSM) 

Allows subnets of vaious size to be used and requirs a protocol that supports it. 

RIP OSPF egrip all support it.  it’s a subnet of subnets. 

chart ffrom /24 to /30 with ips and number of subnets. will help with test day. 

# Subnetting (N10-009)

### What it is

- Breaking a larger network into **smaller subnets** to improve performance, security, and address use.

### Masks & CIDR

- **Subnet mask** splits **network bits (1s)** and **host bits (0s)**.
- **CIDR notation**: `/prefix` = number of network bits.
    - Example: `10.0.0.0/8` (~16.7M host addresses total), `10.0.0.0/24` (256 addresses), `10.0.1.0/24`, `10.0.2.0/24`, etc.

### Core formulas (memorize)

- **Usable hosts per subnet**: `2^(host bits) − 2`
- **Number of subnets when you borrow s bits** (from an original block): `2^s`
- **Block size** in the changing octet: `256 − mask_octet`
    - e.g., mask `255.255.255.192` → `256 − 192 = 64` → subnets start at .0, .64, .128, .192

### VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)

- Use **different prefix lengths** in the same major network to fit varied host needs.
- **Supports VLSM**: **RIPv2**, **OSPF**, **EIGRP**, **IS-IS**, **BGP**
    - **Does NOT support**: **RIPv1** (exam trap)

## High-Yield Example

Need about **60 hosts**? Choose **/26**: mask **255.255.255.192**, **62 usable**.

Subnets of `192.168.1.0/24` split to /26 (block size 64):

- `192.168.1.0/26` → hosts **.1–.62**, bcast **.63**
- `192.168.1.64/26` → hosts **.65–.126**, bcast **.127**
- `192.168.1.128/26` → hosts **.129–.190**, bcast **.191**
- `192.168.1.192/26` → hosts **.193–.254**, bcast **.255**

## Quick Subnet Chart (/24 to /30)

| Prefix | Mask | Usable Hosts | Block Size (4th octet) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /24 | 255.255.255.0 | 254 | 1 |
| /25 | 255.255.255.128 | 126 | 128 |
| /26 | 255.255.255.192 | 62 | 64 |
| /27 | 255.255.255.224 | 30 | 32 |
| /28 | 255.255.255.240 | 14 | 16 |
| /29 | 255.255.255.248 | 6 | 8 |
| /30 | 255.255.255.252 | 2 | 4 |

**Memory trick:** block sizes walk down by halves: **128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4** → /25 → /30.

## Must-Know Classful Defaults (legacy but tested)

- **Class A** `/8` (255.0.0.0) → ~16.7M addresses
- **Class B** `/16` (255.255.0.0) → 65,536 addresses
- **Class C** `/24` (255.255.255.0) → 256 addresses
    
    *(Usable = total − 2)*

## Exam Tips (rapid)

- “~60 hosts?” → **/26**. “~30?” → **/27**. “~14?” → **/28**.
- **Network** = first address (all host bits 0). **Broadcast** = last (all host bits 1).
- **RIPv1** no VLSM; **RIPv2/OSPF/EIGRP** yes VLSM.
- **Block size** trick saves time on finding ranges.

### 5 Rapid Review Qs

1. Usable hosts in **/27**? → **30**
2. Block size for **255.255.255.224**? → **32**
3. First usable in `10.0.5.64/26`? → **10.0.5.65**
4. Broadcast of `172.16.10.0/28`? → **172.16.10.15**
5. Protocol that **doesn’t** support VLSM? → **RIPv1**
