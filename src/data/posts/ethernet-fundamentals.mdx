# Ethernet Fundamentals

Origionally Ethernet was run over coaxial cables using BNC connectors and vampire taps 10Base2 and 10Base5 thinket and thicknet. 

10BASE-T Ethernet allowe up to 10Mbps networks to be run over a twisted pair cable known as a category 3 or CAT 3. 

could only go over 100 meters.  

Deterministic - means the network access shoul be very organized and orderly. like each device has to raise it’s hand to send info. 

Contention-based : used to determine who can get to use the network at a time. like a conversaton at a pub. you wait for your turn then you are able to speak. when doing this you may have collisions. conenton-based models can become extremely chaotiotic. 

Ethernet is a contintion-based networkijng protocol. - lower overhead, don’t need to pass the token, and anyone can talk at any time. 

CSMA/CD - Carrier sense multiple access. with collision detection. - you wait for the gap then send data, if there is a collision then you pause and resend. 

CS - carrirer sensing - listen to the network to see if there is.a signal. 

MA multiple access - many devices that are able to use the network at the same time. 

CD collision detection - if a collision is detected they devices have to decide who goes first. if so they stop and both will resend at a reandom time to talk again. 

Random backoff timer - allows devices to retransmit when the countdown is done. 

so a device sends then has to wait for a random time to send it’s time. 

the more devices communiction on a single network segment the more collisons that you will have. 

Colision domain - each area of the netowrk that shares a single segment. Devices opperate in half duples when connected to a hub. 

Keep collision domains small inside networks.

Ethernet swithc - increase the scaliblity of our networks. each switchport is it’s own collision domain. 

Devices opperate in full-duplex mode when connected to a switch. 

use switches instead of hubs. 

# Ethernet Standards & Access Methods (N10-009)

### **Early Ethernet**

- **10BASE5 (Thicknet):**
    - Coaxial cable with **vampire taps**.
    - Max segment: 500 m.
- **10BASE2 (Thinnet):**
    - Coaxial with **BNC connectors**.
    - Max segment: 185 m.

---

### **10BASE-T**

- Introduced **twisted pair (Cat3)** cabling.
- Speed: **10 Mbps**.
- Distance: **100 m per segment**.
- Became the foundation for modern Ethernet over twisted pair.

# Deterministic vs. Contention

- **Deterministic Access (Token Ring, Token Bus):**
    - Orderly, “raise your hand to talk.”
    - Uses tokens, no collisions.
- **Contention-Based Access (Ethernet):**
    - “Pub conversation” model.
    - Anyone can speak, collisions possible.
    - Lower overhead (no token passing).

# CSMA/CD (Ethernet Legacy)

**Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection**

- **CS (Carrier Sense):** Device listens for quiet network before sending.
- **MA (Multiple Access):** Many devices share the medium.
- **CD (Collision Detection):** If collision occurs → stop, wait, and resend.
- **Random Backoff Timer:** Devices wait a random time before retrying.
- **Issue:** More devices = more collisions.

# Collision Domains

- **Collision Domain:** Segment where collisions can occur.
    - On a hub, **all devices share one collision domain**.
    - Devices operate in **half-duplex**.
- **Switches:**
    - Each switchport = its own collision domain.
    - Devices operate in **full-duplex** → no collisions.
- **Best Practice:** Use **switches** instead of hubs.

✅ **Must-Know Exam Points**

- **10BASE2 = BNC, 185 m.**
- **10BASE5 = vampire taps, 500 m.**
- **10BASE-T = Cat3, 100 m, 10 Mbps.**
- **Ethernet = contention-based (CSMA/CD).**
- **Switch = each port its own collision domain, full duplex.**
- **Hub = one big collision domain, half duplex.**
