# IoT

internet of things - global network of appliances and pwersonal devices that have been equipped with sensors, software and network connectivity to report state and configure data. 

heating systems, automation, 

make sure they are properley secured,  no interfence and power is provided. 

placing tese systems on buisness network is not a best practice. tehse devices should be separated off. 

hackers used the HVAC controlers in the target attack. 

IP video systems - video telcom and skype. 

QoS 

bandwidth 

Upfront Cost for ip video systems. 

some iot devices cannot be pathed. 

hub and control systems - used as a central point of communication for many ioT devices. 

smart deices - iOt devices that connect back to the hub and control system. the light that connects to the amazon alexa 

weables - apple watch 

sensors - measures things like temperature and other things. 

understand endpoints. - understand the vulns and what the are. 

track and manage devices - don‚Äôt let anyone just connect a device. 

patch vulns - they can be insecure first. usea separate vlan. 

conduct test and evaluation. - try to use a pen test. 

change default credentials - 

use encryption protocols. 

segment Iot devices. 

# üåê Internet of Things (IoT)

**Definition:**

Global network of **smart devices, appliances, and sensors** with software + network connectivity that collect and share data.

Examples:

- Smart thermostats, HVAC controllers, lighting, cameras, wearables (Apple Watch), Alexa/Echo, video systems (Skype, IP cams).

## üîë Key Concepts

- **IoT Hub & Controllers**
    - Central point of communication for IoT devices.
    - Example: Smart home hub, Alexa, Google Home.
- **Smart Devices**
    - Individual IoT endpoints connected to the hub.
    - Example: Smart lights, smart plugs.
- **Sensors**
    - Measure data (temperature, motion, pressure, etc.).
- **Wearables**
    - IoT devices worn on the body (e.g., fitness trackers, smart watches).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IoT Risks & Challenges

- **Security Vulnerabilities**
    - Often shipped with weak/default passwords.
    - Many cannot be patched ‚Üí remain exposed.
    - Can be used as entry points for attacks (*Target breach via HVAC controllers*).
- **Performance Concerns**
    - Heavy traffic (e.g., IP video systems) can impact **QoS and bandwidth**.
    - Upfront cost for deployment can be high.
- **Endpoint Management**
    - Hard to track if devices aren‚Äôt inventoried.
    - Shadow IoT = users adding devices without IT approval.

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

- **Network Segmentation**
    - Place IoT on a **separate VLAN or subnet** (never on business-critical LAN).
- **Default Credentials**
    - Always change admin usernames & passwords.
- **Encryption**
    - Use secure protocols (TLS, WPA2/WPA3 for Wi-Fi).
- **Patching**
    - Keep firmware updated (if possible).
    - Replace devices that cannot be patched.
- **Monitoring & Testing**
    - Conduct **vulnerability scans / penetration tests** on IoT segments.
    - Monitor logs and traffic for anomalies.
- **Access Control**
    - Only authorized users should add/manage devices.
    - Use NAC (Network Access Control) where possible.

## ‚úÖ Exam Tips

- IoT = **weakest link in many networks** due to poor security.
- Always associate **Target HVAC attack** with IoT risks.
- **Solution**: segment IoT, enforce strong credentials, patch if possible.
- **QoS** may be needed for IoT video/audio traffic.
