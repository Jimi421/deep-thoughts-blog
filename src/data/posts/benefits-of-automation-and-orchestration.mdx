# Benefits of Automation and Orchestration

Increasing efficency and time savings - Automating task frees up employee time. 

enforcing baselines - streamlined security and compliance. 

implementing standard infrastructure configs - standardized configuritions for security and stability 

scaling in a secure manner - dynamic resource scaling with security compliance

inclreasing employee retention- automating tasks unlocks job fulfillment , empowerers employees to focus on more stratagic.  

increasing reaction times - respond more quickly to security incidents and anomalies through aotimation. 

being a workforce multiplier - Amplifying staff capabilities with automation

# ⚙️ Benefits of Automation

- **Increasing Efficiency & Time Savings**
    - Repetitive tasks automated → frees up employee time.
- **Enforcing Baselines**
    - Security & compliance baselines applied consistently.
    - Reduces human error.
- **Standardized Configurations**
    - Infrastructure configured the same way every time.
    - Improves stability and security.
- **Secure Scaling**
    - Dynamic resource scaling while maintaining compliance.
    - Example: Cloud auto-scaling with security templates.
- **Employee Retention**
    - Removes repetitive “grunt work.”
    - Employees focus on higher-value, strategic tasks.
- **Faster Reaction Times**
    - Automates detection + response to incidents.
    - Example: auto-blocking suspicious IPs.
- **Workforce Multiplier**
    - Amplifies staff capabilities without increasing headcount.
    - One admin can manage many more systems.
