# interference issues

interefencre - multiple networks on the same channel. intereference can lead to re transmissions.

11 

on site survey make sure to look at wha channels. 

on a 2.4 ghz use 1 6 11 to make sure youâ€™re using the whole spectrum. 

use 1. 6. and 11 if using multiple access points ina long hallway, have 10 - j10% overlap so devices can handoff. 

if using 5g using a honeycomb. 

attenuation - redution of signal between the tx and rx can happen for too much distance, wall or other obstical. more noise in the environment. can happen iin the antennaâ€™s cable or in the wave. to increase signal str, possibly increase the quality of the antenna

# ðŸ“¡ Wireless Interference Issues

### What is Interference?

- Occurs when **multiple networks/devices use the same frequency/channel**.
- Causes **collisions, retransmissions, and poor throughput**.

---

### 2.4 GHz Channels

- Only **3 non-overlapping channels**: **1, 6, 11**.
- Best practice:
    - Use **1, 6, 11** when deploying multiple APs.
    - Keep **10â€“15% overlap** for seamless roaming/handoff in long hallways.

---

### 5 GHz Channels

- More available channels than 2.4 GHz.
- Often deployed in a **honeycomb pattern** to avoid overlap and maximize coverage.

---

### Attenuation (Signal Loss)

- **Reduction of signal strength** between transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx).
- Causes:
    - Distance (too far from AP)
    - Walls, floors, physical barriers
    - Environmental noise/interference
    - Antenna cable loss
- Fixes:
    - Higher quality antennas
    - Better cable shielding
    - Proper AP placement

âš¡ **Exam Tips**

- **2.4 GHz = longer range, fewer channels, more interference.**
- **5 GHz = shorter range, more channels, less interference.**
- Remember: **Attenuation â‰  Interference.**
    - Attenuation = weaker signal.
    - Interference = competing signals.
