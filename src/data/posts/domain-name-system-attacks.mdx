# Domain Name System Attacks

DNS ATTCKS - translates ip to hostname. 

DNS Cache poising - Involves corrupting DNS resolver cashe with false information to redirect traffic. Use DNSSEC. Impliment secure network configurations and firewalls. 

DNS amplification attacks - attacker attacks the DNS resolusion process to overwhelm the target. limit the size of DNS responses or reate limit it. 

DNS tunneling it - using the DNS protocol to encapsulate non DNS traffic to attempt to overwrite the access rules and firewall. 

Regulary moniotry DNS logs is important. 

Domain Hijacking (Domain Theft) 

Changing the registration of a domain name without the permission of the owner, can redirec the users to the fake site. 

conduct regular updates 

endusre that the account registration info is secure. use domain registry lock 

DNS one transfer attacks- an attacker tries to get a copy of the einire DNS zone by pretending to be an autoized syste. 

DNS cache poisingin. 

DNS amplificaiton attacks 

DNS tunneling 

Domain hijacking are the common attack types . 

# ARP Attacks (Address Resolution Protocol)

### Purpose of ARP

- Maps **IP address → MAC address** on a LAN.
- Stored in local ARP cache/table.

---

### ARP Spoofing

- Attacker sends **fake ARP replies** to a victim.
- Maps attacker’s MAC to a **legitimate IP** (like the gateway or server).
- Used for **targeted on-path (MITM)** attacks → attacker intercepts victim’s traffic.

---

### ARP Poisoning

- Broader version: corrupts ARP caches of **multiple hosts** on the LAN.
- Attacker associates their MAC with many IPs → traffic is redirected.
- Often done by **ARP flooding**.
- Can disrupt the entire LAN.

---

### Impacts

- **Data Interception** → attacker can read/modify traffic.
- **On-Path Attacks** → attacker invisibly relays traffic between hosts.
- **Network Disruption** → corrupted ARP tables break connectivity.

---

### Tools / Methods

- Attackers scan for IP-MAC pairs, then inject **fake ARP responses**.
- Tools: Ettercap, Cain & Abel, arpspoof.

---

### Mitigation

- **ARP Monitoring Tools:** Detect unusual IP–MAC mappings.
- **IDS/IPS:** Alert on suspicious ARP traffic.
- **Static ARP Entries:** Hard-code mappings for critical devices.
- **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI):** Switches validate ARP against trusted IP–MAC bindings.
- **Network Segmentation (VLANs):** Reduce broadcast domains, limit scope.
- **Encryption (VPN/SSL):** Even if intercepted, traffic is unreadable.

---

✅ **Exam Must-Knows**

- **ARP Spoofing = Targeted MITM.**
- **ARP Poisoning = Broad LAN disruption.**
- Both rely on **sending fake ARP replies**.
- **Defense = DAI, static entries, monitoring, VLANs, encryption.**

⚡Memory Trick:

**“Spoof = Single Target. Poison = Poison the whole LAN.”**
