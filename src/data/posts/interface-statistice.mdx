# interface statistice

link state- communicates weather an interface is up or down. 

reliability 

txload 

rxload 

drop - number that have been dropped 

flush - sounts selective pact discards 

spd - DISCARDS lower priority packets. 

throttle - interface fails to buffer current flow

CRC - number of packets that recived but do not match the checksum

frame - number of packets where a crc non over ru 

Igored 

# üì° Interface & Link-State Monitoring

**Purpose:**

Track the **health and performance of network interfaces** (router, switch ports). Helps with troubleshooting and capacity planning.

## üîë Key Metrics

- **Link State**
    - Shows if an interface is **up or down**.
    - If down ‚Üí cable, port, or hardware failure.
- **Reliability**
    - Measure of interface stability.
    - Expressed as a value (higher = more reliable).
- **Txload (Transmit Load)**
    - Load on the **outbound (sending)** traffic.
    - Indicates how much of the available bandwidth is being used.
- **Rxload (Receive Load)**
    - Load on the **inbound (receiving)** traffic.
    - Shows if the interface is saturated with incoming data.

## üìâ Error & Drop Counters

- **Drop**
    - Packets dropped due to congestion or buffer overflow.
- **Flush**
    - Selective packet discards (often due to QoS policy).
- **SPD (Selective Packet Discard)**
    - Router/switch discards **lower-priority packets** first when congested.
- **Throttle**
    - Indicates the interface is unable to buffer/handle current traffic load.
- **CRC Errors (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**
    - Packets received but **checksum doesn‚Äôt match**.
    - Often due to **cabling issues, interference, or duplex mismatch**.
- **Frame Errors**
    - Corrupted frames that fail checks beyond CRC.
    - Could indicate alignment or physical layer problems.
- **Ignored**
    - Packets dropped because the interface input queue was full.
    - Indicates **buffer/queue overflow**.

## ‚úÖ Exam Tips

- **Link-state up/down** = physical or Layer 1 status.
- **Txload/Rxload** = utilization (capacity vs actual load).
- **CRC/frame errors** = Layer 1 issues (bad cables, interference).
- **Ignored/Drop/Throttle** = congestion or buffer problems.
- **SPD/Flush** = QoS-related selective discards.

‚ö° Sample Question:

*‚ÄúAn interface shows increasing CRC errors. What is the most likely cause?‚Äù*

‚Üí **Faulty cabling or physical interference.**

# üõ†Ô∏è Interface/Link-State Troubleshooting Cheat Sheet

| **Metric / Symptom** | **Likely Cause** |
| --- | --- |
| **Link state down** | Cable unplugged, bad port, power failure, or hardware fault. |
| **High Txload / Rxload** | Interface congestion, bandwidth saturation, too much traffic. |
| **Drops increasing** | Queue/buffer overflow due to congestion. |
| **Flush (selective discards)** | QoS policy dropping packets selectively. |
| **SPD (Selective Packet Discard)** | Router/switch dropping **low-priority packets** under congestion. |
| **Throttle events** | Interface unable to buffer ‚Üí too much traffic for current speed/CPU. |
| **CRC errors** | Faulty cabling, bad connectors, interference, duplex mismatch, or damaged NIC. |
| **Frame errors** | Alignment errors, collisions, physical layer faults, or bad transceivers. |
| **Ignored packets** | Input queue full (buffer overflow), device overwhelmed. |
| **High error rate overall** | Misconfigured speed/duplex, bad cabling, failing hardware, EMI/RFI interference. |

## ‚úÖ Exam Tips

- **CRC = bad cables / interference**.
- **Drops/Ignored = congestion/buffers full**.
- **SPD/Flush = QoS discarding lower-priority packets**.
- **Link state = Layer 1 issue (cable/port)**.
- **Txload/Rxload = traffic utilization**.

‚ö° Sample Question:

*A switch port shows rising CRC errors but low utilization. What‚Äôs the most likely issue?*

‚Üí **Bad cable or interference (physical layer problem).**
