# OBJ 1.6 Wired Network Topology

Network Topology - Refers to the arrangemetn fo the diffentt elements like links, nodes, clients and servers that make up a computer network.

Physical Topology - used to show how the network devices and componets are hysically cabled and conencted together. Physical layout of the cabiling and devices. 

Logical Topoligy - Talks about how the traffic is actualy going to flow in the network. But does not mean that’s where the devices are actually located, just how the data is going to move and flow. 

Point - to point  - Simplest form of t a net topology that involves a dirct connection between two devices. can e

Ring - A network configuration where eachdevice is connected to two other deices and forms a circulsar data path. If one node fails al are done. FDDI fiber disctibuted Data Interface used to conduct data transmissions on fibur optioc lines. works ona. ring for long distances. High bandwidth campus area network and data centers. 

Bus All Network Devices are conneted to a single centeral cable and called a bus or backbone. As more devices are added performance will fail, older tech. 

Star Topology - one of the most common network layouts that is in use today. Each node is connected to a switch, which is also a repeater. If central device fails entire network fails. 

Hub and Spoke Topoogy Varaiation of Star where the central nde (hub) is connected to multple nodes (spokes) think about ups with the hub and center models. raleigh is the hub wilmington is the cnter, FedEx has a different set of hubs ect.. 

Mesh Topology - Features a point-to-point connection between every single device on the network to create a robust and redundant network. 

Full Mesh - every node conneted to every other node … number of connections x = n(n-1)/2

partial mesh - some nodes are in a full mesh, others are only connected to one or two devices.
