# SLAAC - statless address autoconfiguration.

SLAAC allows for automatic iP addresses without DHCP. Forsterr self sufficency and reduce administrative overhead of adding IP addresses. 

5 setp process. 

Domain Name System - DNS - helps resolve a hostname from an ip address. convetrts name to numbers and numbers to names. 

Fully-Qalified Domain Name - when a domain name is with a top level provider. 

Root - answer requests in the root zone

top level domain com .net .uk 

second-level domain jimi421.com

subdomain [blog.jimi421.com](HTTP://blog.jimi421.com), mail.jimi421.com

host - refers to a specefic machine

URL - uniform resource locator. 

Host file - simple text file taht servs as the first point of contact when a device wants to seek out communication with another device on a network. 

Malicious attackers can exploit this. 

# SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration) – IPV6

- Allows devices to **self-assign IPV6 addresses** without DHCP.
- Reduces admin overhead → plug-and-play networking.
- Works with **Router Advertisements (RA)**.

**5-Step SLAAC Process:**

1. **Device Init** – Generates temporary link-local address.
2. **Router Solicitation** – Device asks local routers for info.
3. **Router Advertisement** – Router provides network prefix.
4. **Address Configuration** – Device combines prefix + unique ID (often EUI-64 from MAC).
5. **Duplicate Address Detection** – Device checks for conflicts before finalizing.

**Exam Tip:** SLAAC = IPV6 self-config, DHCP not required.
